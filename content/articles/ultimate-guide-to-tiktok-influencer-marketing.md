<p>TikTok influencer marketing is gaining more ground as both TikTok and influencer marketing expand. The two are seemingly made for each other because both thrive on authenticity, creativity, and viral content.</p><p>And let’s face it; if the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@washingtonpost">Washington Post</a> is ravaging TikTok with its comedy skits, your brand can do it too.</p><p>You just need to find out where to start. This ultimate guide to TikTok influencer marketing will tell you how to leverage TikTok in your next campaign. We’ll take you through all the steps, show you examples, and discuss strategy.</p><p>Read more below!</p><h2 id="is-tiktok-good-for-influencer-marketing">Is TikTok Good for Influencer Marketing?</h2><p>Most people associate TikTok with a teen demographic, but that’s not the entire story. <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/tiktok-is-growing-up-and-so-are-its-users/">According to Comscore</a>, the 20-39 generation represents 46% of TikTok users, while teens represent 32.5%.</p><p><strong>That means TikTok has many people with significant purchasing power.</strong></p><p>Another advantage is that those people make purchase decisions according to influencers’ recommendations.</p><p>There’s another thing to consider:</p><p><strong>Those kids will soon grow up to have significant purchasing power too. </strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/04/03/what-to-know-about-influencer-marketing-on-tiktok/?sh=1323e0646f30">According to Forbes</a>, this generation will shortly amount to 40% of all consumers.</p><p>And Gen Z <em><strong>hates</strong></em> traditional advertising.</p><p><strong>Warning: </strong>The worst mistake your company can ever make on TikTok is to post ads that look traditional, as in following a script.</p><p>That’s why influencer marketing is best for TikTok. These content creators:</p><ul><li>Are outstanding at storytelling</li><li>Keep your messages authentic</li><li>Address a broad and loyal fan base</li></ul><p>Sure, you can try creating a <a href="https://socialbee.io/blog/tiktok-marketing-content-plan/">TikTok business account</a> and promoting your brand in the traditional way. However, building and reaching out to the desired audience is challenging.</p><p>That brings us to the following question:</p><h2 id="how-does-influencer-marketing-work-on-tiktok"><br>How Does Influencer Marketing Work on TikTok?</h2><p>This “Ultimate Guide to TikTok Influencer Marketing” wouldn’t exactly be a guide without some practical advice. Let’s see how TikTok <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/micro-influencer-marketing-the-ultimate-guide/">influencer marketing</a> works and how you can use it:</p><h3 id="who-is-your-audience">Who Is Your Audience?</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bxatiIxclRGPxj8aV5QW5tOn1SUKoH5a6rSb4x78xPd2TgaFLNLhg53oqEH9UaAr1vY5ILD_U2hDjNevguQdf0k9A5t6UUYGhCEwf7zSJRRYnVFZcDD7IgM47pJG6BknpQ89Hb0E" class="kg-image" alt="A white board with arrows pointing to the word &quot;Audience&quot;."><figcaption>Before anything, determine your target audience on TikTok. (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/U33fHryBYBU">Image source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>The key with any TikTok influencer marketing campaign is to understand your audience:</p><ul><li>The products they like</li><li>The messages they prefer</li><li>The content they look at</li><li>Their problems</li><li>Their needs</li><li>Their wants</li></ul><p>These factors are essential because you can’t simply list your products’ features in TikTok ads. Instead, you have to focus on the benefits for your target audience.</p><p>The thing is that each segment of that audience is interested in distinct advantages. At the same time, they all dislike traditional ads.</p><p><br><strong><strong>Here’s the solution.</strong></strong></p><p>Allow more flexibility and independence to your influencer partners. Remember that these content creators have broad, captive audiences that listen to them for a reason.</p><p>So, use their credibility, charisma, and expertise to your advantage.</p><p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Let go of the script, but don’t give up total control of your messages:</p><ul><li><strong>Establish ground rules with your content creators.</strong> Be specific about elements you want to include in their messages and the details you absolutely don’t want to see.</li><li><strong>Think of all worst-case scenarios that can happen after starting your TikTok campaign.</strong> Next, think of different solutions that you can apply during these crises.</li><li><strong>Ask your influencers for feedback.</strong> Even before outlining your campaign, ask these content creators about their audience’s preferences, patterns, and so forth. Make sure you keep an open mind, even if it’s something you don’t want to hear.</li></ul><h3 id="how-do-you-find-influencers">How Do You Find Influencers?</h3><p><a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/finding-tik-tok-influencers/">Finding influencers</a> isn’t always easy, even though TikTok is full of them. You could try to:</p><ul><li><strong>Search for influencers by keywords or popular hashtags.</strong> You know your company’s industry, right? Let’s say you’re making/selling ergonomic pillows. Input specific keywords in TikTok’s Discovery Page, such as “sleep,” “home-sweet-home,” or “bed.”</li><li><strong>Analyze TikTok’s lists of top active users.</strong> Check out the <a href="https://socialblade.com/tiktok/top/100">Top 100 Users</a> list if you have a large company. Otherwise, look at the Top 5000 database to see if you find a match with your brand.</li><li><strong>Search for location-based relevant hashtags. </strong>If you run that pillow business locally, you want people coming into your store and touching your products. The tactile experience is paramount when buying ergonomic products. Use the TikTok search function to input your city’s name or the name of a local influencer you Googled previously.</li><li><strong>Use search engines. </strong>Type what you’re interested in into Google and see what pops up.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Warning:</strong> </strong>These methods above work well, but they take a lot of time. The problem is, after short-listing a few influencers, you’ll have to check their audiences to ensure they fit your target. Next, you’ll have to send them messages to see if these content creators want to work with you. Then, you’ll want to agree on a budget.</p><p><strong>There’s a quicker solution, though:</strong></p><p><strong><strong>You can try an </strong><a href="https://www.inbeat.co/micro-influencer-platform/"><strong>influencer platform</strong></a><strong>.</strong> </strong><a href="http://www.inbeat.co/">inBeat</a>, for example, reunites many content creators from different fields.

You want to increase your gains and expand your company.</p><p>Here’s how you do it.</p><p><strong>First, ask yourself what types of content work well on TikTok. </strong>Your best performance indicator is share-ability. The TikTok videos that people—your people—share the most are the ones they resonate with. These video clips can be:</p><ul><li>Original <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/the-ultimate-guide-to-tiktok-music-marketing/">music</a></li><li>Dance routines</li><li>Dance challenge</li><li>Comedic skits</li><li>How-to</li><li>Tips and demonstrations</li><li>Cringe clips</li><li>Duets</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/a1eySi9CHI4P1dTj7pJ1ueYO9tJgVyMu_u7BRLDqd-fCra8aChTa36orRznbx_NnHxtkGyFEJJVkC4M7xaiQ-sckYrU8DhsFotxs9aU_KVxSFoNrQNg9hM3P_qXBu1q_hhBWgKqv" class="kg-image" alt="Two young women recording themselves doing a dance."><figcaption>The right type of content on TikTok can drive ROI. (<a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-in-white-sleeveless-shirt-and-blue-denim-skirt-holding-black-smartphone-6003271/">Image source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s essential to know your audience first to create appealing content those people will engage with.</p><p>Below is a rundown of TikTok content that works the best. You can use these ads in combination with your influencer campaigns:</p><ul><li><strong>In-Feed Ads </strong>are short-form video ads that fit into TikTok’s format. You can adapt these ads to your target based on primary demographic factors like age, location, and gender. These ads cost $10/impression, so you need about $6,000 to start your campaign.</li><li><strong>Brand takeover ads.</strong> These ads are the most actionable and get users to your landing pages directly, but they’re also the most expensive. Prepare a $50,000 budget/day.</li><li><strong>Challenge ads. </strong>These ads work like regular challenges on TikTok, with one difference: they promote <em><strong>your</strong> </em>branded hashtags. As a result, you’ll raise awareness and receive tons of <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/what-is-ugc/">user-generated content</a> that you can repurpose. Don’t forget to send TikTok users to a page with precise instructions to get the <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/how-to-create-a-ugc-strategy-on-tiktok/">UGC</a> you want.</li><li><strong>Shoppable ads. </strong>These ads give your challenges a shoppable dimension because people can click on the Explore tab after visiting your hashtag-challenge page. This tab has a “Shop Now” feature that sends people to your website’s landing page.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Influencer marketing ads should take center stage in your campaign, though.</strong></strong></p><p>This content should generate:</p><ul><li><strong>A high level of engagement</strong>: measured particularly in the quality of the comments you receive and the number of shares. Likes and views take second place.</li><li><strong>Positive brand sentiment</strong>: measured by the number and quality of brand mentions and the user-generated content that becomes viral.</li><li><strong>Conversions</strong>: measured in the number of sales, sign-ups to your newsletter, or downloads.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Pro tip: </strong></strong>If you want to achieve these results, make sure the content created and distributed by your influencer is:</p><ul><li>Authentic</li><li>Relevant</li><li>Relatable</li><li>Inspirational</li><li>Original</li></ul><p>This type of content will soon become viral, which means your brand will become a trendsetter.</p><p>Start with your audience’s needs, beliefs, and problems to get it right!</p><p></p><h2 id="tiktok-influencer-marketing-strategy">TikTok Influencer Marketing Strategy</h2><p>Your <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/micro-influencer-marketing-the-ultimate-guide/">influencer marketing strategy</a> on TikTok will be very similar to your other campaign strategies. Here are the six steps to take.</p><h3 id="research">Research</h3><p>This preliminary step will set the tone for your entire campaign. It’s also the cornerstone that will establish your success, so:</p><ul><li><strong>Understand your brand’s values, personality, and history</strong></li><li><strong>Figure out your audience</strong>, what they care about, and how they address those problems. Your audience’s language is equally important because you’ll have to speak in terms that appeal to these people when you craft your messages.</li><li><strong>Learn about your competitors.</strong> You want to see how they’re performing and what strategies they’re adopting. Try to find an unoccupied niche in your consumers’ minds, meaning a problem that’s left unaddressed. That will help you come up with your unique selling proposition.</li><li><strong>Learn about TikTok.</strong> If this channel is entirely new for you, research it to see what content performs best.</li></ul><h3 id="goals"><strong><strong>Goals</strong></strong></h3><p>Set specific and realistic goals that fit your business objectives. For instance, you can:</p><ul><li>Drive more UGC</li><li>Increase brand awareness</li><li>Encourage more downloads</li><li>Improve sales</li></ul><p>These goals should be based on a precise sales funnel. One example is the Awareness-Consideration-Action model.</p><p>In the first step, you attract attention to your brand by using prominent influencers. In the second step, consideration, you have to engage your potential customers. The people that become loyal to your brand at this step will be genuinely interested in your products. Finally, the third and final step gets people to decide.</p><p>Don’t forget to set clear KPIs that tell you if you’ve reached those goals.</p><h3 id="influencers">Influencers</h3><p>Research different TikTok influencers in terms of their:</p><ul><li>Track record</li><li>Previous content</li><li>Engagement (you can use an <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/engagement-rate-calculator-tiktok">engagement rate calculator</a>)</li><li>Relationship with your audience</li><li>Shared values and interests</li></ul><p><strong>Warning: </strong>You may think the number of followers is an important metric, but it’s not as relevant as the factors above. While it is something to consider, a content creator’s following count alone does not indicate their quality as a potential business partner for an influencer campaign.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5BlY06ToKSqN_g5ZKi50vMpOoxtV44kb0tELmNcc3qdLX4TM0el0uX0jdG8tsFyP9kPO1WTzhqGYD4i2q_50eGrjFQuA_E7m4KMRdLB7H1Gj1UMgCQmmDoZoffoDBiIIwbX6qFmj" class="kg-image" alt="A screenshot of inBeat TikTok engagement rate calculator, a great tool for influencer marketing."><figcaption>A high engagement rate is a great indicator of an influencer’s relationship with their audience.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="message">Message</h3><p>Set clear guidelines regarding the posts you want these influencers to create and allow them enough creative freedom to sound authentic. You can highlight these details in your <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/influencer-creative-brief-template/">Influencer creative brief</a>. Remember that your messages should:</p><ul><li>Speak your audience’s language.</li><li>Create a connection between you and your potential customers.</li><li>Make you number one in people’s minds, without your brand becoming too intrusive or too evident in the actual message.</li></ul><p><strong><a href="https://central.gymshark.com/article/66-days-change-your-life"><strong>Gymshark’s 66 Days: Change Your Life Challenge</strong></a><strong> is one of the best examples.</strong> </strong>TikTok users had to pick a fitness goal and document their before-and-after progress. This challenge worked because:</p><ul><li>Gymshark chose six popular influencers that together had a sizeable audience of 19.8 million people.</li><li>TikTok users had a precise task with an obvious goal.</li><li>It motivated people because they felt like being part of a community. They also wanted to show off their hard work and bask in their peers’ success.</li><li>Gymshark used a tangible motivation, too: one year’s worth of Gymshark supplies.</li></ul><p>The results speak for themselves, as Gymshark got:</p><ul><li>45.5 million views</li><li>2 million likes</li><li>An engagement rate of 11%</li></ul><p><strong>Warning: </strong>Make sure these messages are FTC-compliant to avoid any legal issues.</p><h3 id="channels"><br>Channels</h3><p>Although TikTok takes center stage in this strategy, you can repurpose the content created for this social media platform. For example, you can share <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/ugc-marketing-an-ultimate-guide-to-leverage-user-generated-content/">UGC</a> on other social media channels or your business e-mails. You can mention your influencers on your website, or you can congratulate a specific customer at an in-person event.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/wX72spdcc_2bSam16QxisFWdPGv55l9dzS5-regUCZrc-zZc1UvOj-ES6_FB7UvzCZcLX13t6rKhgzRMTglWKHpLCIoNgMaTx248s0HYbc0ZRstX2S5_A4ktdCfAPuDR2LjZpZ5a" class="kg-image" alt="A smartphone with various social media apps, such as Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter."><figcaption>You can repurpose TikTok content on other social media channels.
