<p></p><p>Influencer marketing is a billion-dollar industry. It’s used by huge names like Coca-Cola and North Face, but also small-scale companies. Influencers also range from well-known celebrities like Dwayne The Rock Johnson to niche stars like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdZklq8ZUwbwQBLPpIzcz1g">Richard Fanders</a>, a UK driving instructor with an impressive following.</p><p>Micro-influencers have a lot of expertise in their respective fields. This objective knowledge, along with their credibility and charisma, helps them grow their community organically.</p><p>And best of all, that loyal audience follows these influencers actively. Thus, when Richard Fanders recommends specific insurance companies or apps that help regular people study for their driving exams, they trust him and buy these products.</p><p>That’s how <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/micro-influencer-platform/">micro-influencers</a> work and why you should hop on this train.</p><p>Read below to learn how to get the best out of this practice.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-micro-influencer">What Is a Micro-Influencer?</h2><p>A micro-influencer is a social media “idol” with a 10-100k follower count. People follow these influencers because they’re interested in their opinions or advice regarding a particular field.</p><p>For instance, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/curlbellaa/">Angela Onuoha</a> offers excellent tutorials for skincare and hairstyles. Her fans look up to her because she’s a natural; she gives unique insights and truly understands her audience. More importantly, she practices what she preaches.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hhdXTVQFwvw4fX07Dw5eG6XmDztOy2XrP5UjRZL8Yv4ofzUIFyHZ-XKPMZem9U6xwYhTWY6gnPnKRyXIx6CsgCcX9b0Ha5DUaJCmHFfOppGLHTS-NivUuqlQ9ZrLjvp0uHN-PQok" class="kg-image"><figcaption><a href="https://www.instagram.com/curlbellaa/">Image source</a></figcaption></figure><p>In short, micro-influencers are relatable, likeable, and approachable.</p><p>They seem like run-of-the-mill people, but they also lead glamorous lives that their loyal followers look up to. Thus, micro-influencers seem more genuine than celebrities or mega influencers.</p><p>As a result, people trust them more.</p><p>And as you’ve known for some time, trust is a significant issue in advertising. Your audience knows that your company’s goal is to sell, so even if you’re 100% focused on your customers’ needs, there will always be a lingering suspicion in the background.</p><p>Knowing that, the best thing you can do is let someone else speak for you.</p><ul><li>Micro-influencers are more trustworthy than brands for <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200526005058/en/Matter-Survey-Reveals-Consumers-Find-Influencers-More-Helpful-and-Trustworthy-than-Brands-During-the-Pandemic">61% of people</a>.</li><li>A micro-influencer has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2021/06/02/micro-influencers-when-smaller-is-better/?sh=26f288a9539b">a 60% higher engagement rate</a> and a 20% higher conversion rate than a macro-influencer.</li><li><a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/influencer-marketing-trends">75% of brands</a> intended to allocate a specific budget for influencers in 2021.</li></ul><p>Speaking of budgets, that brings us to a sore point:</p><h2 id="how-much-do-micro-influencers-cost">How Much Do Micro-Influencers Cost?</h2><p>These social media stars don’t have a set-in-stone salary or fee they demand. There’s not even a rule-of-thumb for micro-influencers costs because their payment depends on things like:</p><ul><li>Their engagement rate</li><li>The duration of the influencer marketing campaign</li><li>Their degree of involvement in the campaign</li><li>The type of content provided</li><li>The usage rights agreement</li></ul><p>Just look at the Instagram pay gap for influencers to see <a href="https://www.instagram.com/influencerpaygap/">how much the price fluctuates</a>.</p><p>For example, a 15-second TikTok video with a 2% engagement rate can be more expensive than a 15-minute YouTube video with a 0.5% engagement rate. And it’s obvious <em>which</em> influencer worked harder for that content.</p><p>However, if the first influencer doesn’t give you usage rights, you might just pay them less in the end—or you might pay them more if you want to continue your relationship with them.</p><p>It may sound very complicated, but don’t worry, it’s pretty straightforward. Once you get used to the process, you’ll see it’s like hiring any other employee for any different job position.</p><h2 id="the-advantages-of-working-with-micro-influencers">The Advantages Of Working With Micro-Influencers</h2><p>Working with micro-influencers has three major advantages.</p><h3 id="1-it-s-a-very-cost-effective-way-of-reaching-a-diverse-audience">1. It’s a very cost-effective way of reaching a diverse audience</h3><p>Micro-influencers charge much less for promoting products while still having a high conversion rate—<a href="https://www.ana.net/blogs/show/id/mm-blog-2020-02-micro-influencers-better-content">22.2x more conversion</a> than a typical user, to be exact.</p><p>The good part is that you can split that marketing budget between various micro-influencers instead of spending it all on one massive celebrity or a macro-influencer.</p><p>That way, you can target and convert people from different audiences—even niche audiences that don’t directly connect to your brand.</p><p>Here’s one example:</p><p>Daniel Wellington, the famous watch brand, addresses a surprising audience through some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/danielwellington/tagged/?hl=en">very diverse influencers</a> across the globe. These influential people have different sized audiences from all corners of the world and, sometimes, polar-opposite interests.</p><p>But somehow, this brand has still managed to target these people through the micro-influencers it hired.</p><h3 id="2-you-re-addressing-niche-communities">2. You’re addressing niche communities</h3><p>Your micro-influencer is speaking to a targeted audience who are already loyal followers. That way, the influencer’s reach grows organically on social media, and they’re perceived as trustworthy.</p><p>When a trustworthy micro-influencer recommends a product, their audience listens… and converts.</p><p>Beware: ensure that your micro-influencers don’t push your products too aggressively towards their audience. The process of increasing social exposure and speaking to a new niche should go smoothly.</p><p>For example, the US has enlisted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/01/technology/vaccine-lies-influencer-army.html">an influencer army to fight vaccine-related myths</a> on all social media platforms. Having such a broad array of influencers allowed authorities to reach a larger pool of people, from very young audiences through the voice of 18-year-old pop star Olivia Rodrigo, to skeptic communities of colour, through the voice of police officer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sergeantcornejo/posts/288469026166668">Carlos Cornejo</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wUh_Hmf4K8bN28If675xrlRZgWE-Cylr8baOFtWOZOI3Q2TPaLXq1iQSRja-drhVj8Hi7BvhyXyQyVtaZfCgt4ez0p0h888_ceBTVF7yZ40dwI965NRxd0qTlstc0W8ObVeBkeO3" class="kg-image"><figcaption><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sergeantcornejo/posts/288469026166668">Image source</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="3-micro-influencers-have-high-engagement-rates">3. Micro-influencers have high engagement rates</h3><p>Micro-influencers have higher engagement rates than mid-tier or macro-influencers. You can get more audiences to buy your message for a lower price.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KX0SNFe0WJDcjTakdtEyrfBRtFM94vajGff7gIEci6m7_8hb3dStA9BkGKYMxwtMOfoIrJTZvljy_I0VqF507Iy6FQntk5rUSy2bMoHgOJIGHSliyB6WrgGbvD6WHFZk9nt_u7GP" class="kg-image"><figcaption><a href="https://later.com/blog/influencer-engagement-rate">Image source</a></figcaption></figure><p><br>Besides, these engagement rates come from supportive communities that view the influencers as their idol.</p><p>If real people see that their social media star is endorsing your brand, they’ll also become your loyal, engaged audience. You won’t just end up with some conversions and a larger ROI in the short term. You’ll get a more extensive and diverse brand community in the long run.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Before you dream big, make sure that your potential customers quickly get to your product page from their influencer’s post. One seamless click would be ideal.</p><h2 id="how-to-work-with-a-micro-influencer">How to Work with a Micro-Influencer<br></h2><p>Setting up a micro-influencer campaign will increase awareness and will drive more people to your website. As a result, you can improve your sales.</p><p>Here are the steps to ensure those increased sales become a reality:</p><h3 id="1-set-up-your-goals">1. Set Up Your Goals</h3><p>Before even choosing your micro-influencers, make sure you’re very clear on your campaign goals and audience. These things will help you choose the right KPIs, so you’ll also know the correct metrics that will help you measure your campaign’s success.</p><p>But back to those goals.</p><p>Ask any CEO, and they’ll say their primary goal is to increase ROI.</p><p>Usually, marketing people have a good sense that this should be their end goal, even if they know that sometimes you want to raise awareness or drive traffic to your website first.</p><p>There are two problems. First,  <a href="https://startupbonsai.com/influencer-marketing-statistics/">78% of marketers</a> say measuring their influencer campaign’s ROI is challenging. Second, <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/influencer-marketing-statistics">86% of marketers</a> consider raising brand awareness the primary goal of their influencer marketing campaigns.</p><p>You can’t have all the companies out there using influencers just to increase awareness. Besides, that would be a waste of money, so it’s more likely that marketers feel overwhelmed by influencer campaigns.</p><p>To solve this problem, you need to have faith that your influencers will deliver those desired results. Just go ahead and outline your campaign goals and objectives.</p><p>Next, choose the right influencers for the job.</p><h3 id="2-finding-and-vetting-micro-influencers">2. Finding and Vetting Micro-Influencers</h3><p>The first step of choosing a micro-influencer is seeing how well they fit your brand’s values and target audience. You should also look at their:</p><ul><li><strong>Engagement rates</strong>—personal comments, shares, and questions show much more engagement than likes or drab comments.</li><li><strong>Audience</strong>—make sure the influencer isn’t buying any fake accounts.</li><li><strong>Posting frequency </strong>– you need a micro-influencer that consistently posts because you want your brand to become your audience’s top of mind.</li><li><strong>Personality</strong>—that influencer should have a unique voice; they should bring unique insights and create value for their followers.</li></ul><p>You can read more about how to find the right influencers <a href="https://inbeat.agency/micro-influencer-marketing-a-complete-guide-2021/">here</a>. In the meantime, let’s summarize the main ways of zeroing in on the right people for your needs:</p><ul><li><strong>Your social media accounts. </strong>Do any of your already-existing loyal fans have a 10-100k following? Because if they do, they certainly qualify as micro-influencers. And if they already love your brand, what more could you want?</li><li><strong>Branded hashtags.</strong> These hashtags point you toward micro-influencers who appreciate your company and want to share your products with the world.</li><li><strong>Recommended influencers. </strong>Instagram and YouTube both offer suggestions to influencers that would fit your brand.</li><li><strong>Specific tools. </strong><a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/using-inbeat/">inBeat.co</a> is an excellent place to start because you get access to an extensive database of influencers along with additional features. inBeat will help you keep track of your influencers’ posts, measure their success, and keep in close contact with them.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JbkA67lAHw4vzDni2O9BxQHvdNGvWp9m1DA6vSUkFZQJVAfcSQcwie6fJLjYS3BHt72j_oyP4mUaI8ybCtRGRUcHM34_-6t0ELEpou7iEYyOAXJQM-xjkODhoSITNV01E-j1DtG1" class="kg-image"><figcaption>inBeat's platform</figcaption></figure><h3 id="3-negotiations-and-contract-signing"><br>3. Negotiations and Contract Signing</h3><p>Once you’ve found the right micro-influencers, it’s time to pitch them. First, you’ll see that most influencers already have rate cards where they include their fees.</p><p>After you’ve double-checked your budget, send your favourite micro-influencers a message. You’re probably already good at negotiations, but here are a few tips anyway:</p><ul><li>Ask for the influencer’s advice or input regarding your campaign.</li><li>Tell them why you’d be a good fit.</li><li>Provide a helpful suggestion to kick off your conversation.</li></ul><p>Once you’ve caught your micro-influencer’s attention, it’s time for the negotiations to begin.</p><p>The payment can be:</p><ul><li>A lump sum</li><li>CPA (cost per action)</li><li>Specific rewards, discounts, or access to exclusive products</li></ul><p>You should also discuss what the influencer should do during your campaign. For example, if they’re posting a photo wearing your product, should they also sport that same product at a specific party? Should they wear that every day or just occasionally? Is it OK for the influencers to use other branded products or even your competitors’ products?</p><p>Once you’ve got all these things straightened out, it’s time to write up a contract that should include:</p><ul><li>Payment method, time, and deadlines</li><li>Briefing materials</li><li>Expected deliverables and channels</li><li>Content deadlines</li><li>Approval process</li><li>Contract length</li><li>Copyrights</li><li>Exclusivity clause</li><li>Cancellation policy</li></ul><p>You can download our ready-to-use <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/influencer-agreement-template/">influencer agreement template</a>.</p><h3 id="4-managing-micro-influencers-monitor-and-evaluate-campaign-results">4. Managing Micro-influencers: Monitor and Evaluate Campaign Results</h3><p>It’s vital to track and evaluate micro-influencer campaigns carefully. We already told you that many marketing managers and digital marketers are apprehensive about this point.</p><p>But if you’ve set the right KPIs according to well-thought campaign goals, you shouldn’t have any problems.</p><p>Here are some strategies you can use for following your campaign’s performance:</p><p><strong>Instagram’s tools.</strong> Seeing as the micro-influencers' preferred platform is Instagram, you’re probably going to use this channel, too. There’s no reason you shouldn’t also use its tools. As each micro-influencer uses the “paid partnership” hashtag, you can easily track their individual performance.</p><ul><li><strong>Trackable links. </strong>Tracking your links allows you to centralize all of your influencers’ posts. That way, you can evaluate all the numbers and see the campaign’s success.</li><li><strong>Promo codes. </strong>Putting a unique discount code on each influencers’ post will tell you how many people have converted using each code. That way, you’ll know how many sales each of your influencers generated.</li><li><strong>Google Analytics. </strong>This tool allows you to quantify traffic increase from a new market, which is tough to do unless everyone uses hashtags and trackable links.</li><li><a href="https://www.inbeat.co/features/influencer-tracking-software/"><strong>inBeat tracking software.</strong></a><strong> </strong>inBeat is an influencer marketing agency that identifies your KPIs and automatically tracks each of your influencers’ performance. Besides, inBeat organizes all the content created by Instagram and TikTok micro-influencers. You will get overall campaign metrics, top performance, plus one-click reporting to make your life much easier.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uYzeJqMRqt384gitRgUQI4o_i2nZA093U47mvVAfgLu_I4ue0p3VJTyd3qq9j1vlSaCsxC_xhWm7vhxpBNn9GSgU9Y9rxUxDvwj4_fmq7fFHOobSWI4LHQcfxME_yVNmrBrimuRZ" class="kg-image"><figcaption><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CR3zYs1CM4T/">An example</a> of branded hashtags and a promo code</figcaption></figure><h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2><p>Using micro-influencers is a cost-effective way to generate unique content about your brand, raise awareness, and increase engagement. At the end of the day, all of these advantages will help your business flourish.</p><p>However, it’s essential to be brave.</p><p>Many marketers don’t have enough experience with influencer marketing, and that makes them wary. Mistakes may happen–such as not choosing the right goals, getting tricked by an influencer with a fake audience, and not even establishing campaign KPIs.</p><p>Why not deal with your micro-influencer marketing campaign with professionals?</p><p>Once you’ve set your goals and performance indicators, using the right tools will save you lots of time and energy. <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/">inBeat.co</a> is an excellent choice because our <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/micro-influencer-platform/">platform</a> allows you to choose the best influencers <em>and</em> measure your results seamlessly.</p><p><a href="https://app.inbeat.co/get-started">Try it for free</a> and see for yourself.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
