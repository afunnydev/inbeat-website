<p>In their 2002 book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Advertising-Rise-PR/dp/0060081996"><em>The Fall of Advertising and the Rise of PR</em></a>, marketing experts Al and Laura Rise foresaw traditional advertising’s impending doom. It was evident for a few decades that people were sick of being spammed with unwanted advertising.</p><p>Consumers live in a world that throws buckets of information over their heads daily, and a lot of that info is fake or exaggerated.</p><p>The paradox of choice is ever-so-present at every purchase.</p><p>It’s no wonder that everyone feels submerged in uncertainty, and it’s only apparent that consumers want something sure to cling themselves to.</p><p>That bit of certainty is other people’s recommendations.</p><p><a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/what-is-ugc/">User-generated content</a> has become that third-party PR that Al and Laura Rise saw as the brands’ salvation. But does it really work? And how can you use it to your advantage?</p><p>Let’s analyze 40 UGC stats that help you see the bigger picture.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/T1j7-MfiMN-gGI_KDWnmhnYHtvJo5IeMBfRiS9N8CRWWhr5fZM8EVR89AJKYyi3PwjSPokLmqcA7kZQoOGZZ0xL-f_qjhQmnafv1Zd7TzIaVqK24537LteXTWB8qn3nAz_494alN" class="kg-image" alt="User-Generated Content on various social media platforms has a lot of value."></figure><h2 id="ugc-stats-about-revenue"><br>UGC Stats about Revenue</h2><p><strong><strong>User-generated content brings you more revenues and at a lower cost, according to</strong> <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/68976197-4-tactics-to-drive-traffic-and-sales-with-user-generated-content"><strong>Shopify</strong></a><strong>:</strong></strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> Ads based on UGC have a click-through rate that’s 400% higher than traditional ads.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> UGC ads cost 50% less than average ads.</p><p><strong><strong>And things get even better because you can use your employees to generate more helpful content, according to a study</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503014941/http:/blog.kredible.com:80/employee-advocacy-statistics-2016"><strong>at Kredible</strong></a><strong>:</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>3.</strong> </strong>The average amount that an employee advocacy program can generate is $1.9 million in advertising value with 1,000 active participants.</p><h2 id="ugc-stats-about-content-sharing">UGC Stats about Content Sharing</h2><p><strong>So what motivates people to share your online content?</strong></p><p><br>The New York Times Customer Insight Group has, well, <em>insight</em> on that.

Most responders share UGC to define themselves. </strong>68% of people perceive themselves in relation to the brands they purchase because they represent their values.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>People share information that helps them connect to their peers. </strong>78% of responders will convey your brand’s content if it helps them nourish important relationships in their lives.</p><p><strong>7. Self-fulfillment is vital for sharing UGC.</strong> 69% of people share content related to your brand because they believe doing so counts for something in the world.</p><p><strong>8.

It can propel you to new markets, more people will find out about your message, and you can create an active brand community.</p><p>But more importantly, you can reap all those advantages <strong>at a much more reduced cost </strong>compared to traditional advertising.</p><p>Here are some <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/ex/mobilemarketer/cms/news/content/17349.html">other stats</a> that can inspire you to make a move towards user-generated content.</p><p><strong>38. </strong>User-generated content determines:</p><ul><li>88% increased social media activity.</li><li>29% more web conversions</li><li>25% higher ad performance.</li></ul><p><strong>39. 93% of consumers find UGC helpful</strong> when making purchase decisions.</p><p><strong>40. Millennials are a significant audience for UGC because they spend 30% of their media time interacting with UGC content </strong>(a whopping 5.4 hours/day).</p><p>But here’s the thing:</p><p>You have to employ user-generated content carefully if you want more people to post good things about your brand.</p><p>For instance,<strong> carefully choosing your ambassadors is vital.</strong> Employees and loyal customers are credible sources because they know a lot of things about your brand. Moreover, they’re passionate about your products because they share the same values, so they’ll invest more effort into promoting your brand.</p><p>And here’s another advantage.</p><p><strong>Loyal customers and employees know—or better yet, </strong><em><strong>sense—</strong></em><strong>your brand’s values and language.</strong> These two factors are essential in creating any community because they help define how people act.</p><p><br>Remember that people are more inclined to share user-generated content if that content:</p><ul><li>Is about their values</li><li>Promotes a cause they’re interested in</li><li>Allows them social recognition</li></ul><p>Sure, tangible rewards like prizes and discounts are essential too, but not <em>as</em> critical as helping your customers define their social status through your brand.</p><p>Also, <strong>employ UGC in all channels, but start from your customers’ needs. </strong>If you don’t organize your <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/ugc-marketing-an-ultimate-guide-to-leverage-user-generated-content/">UGC marketing strategy</a> through the lens of those needs, your efforts can fail.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><strong>UGC in email marketing</strong> can help you personalize those messages, but it’s important to send people recommendations and discounts that relate to their interests.</li><li><strong>UGC on Instagram</strong> can attract more customers, but only if it helps solve a specific problem.</li><li><strong>UGC on YouTube</strong> has to contain more than one brand. A person spends just a few seconds on an Instagram photo but can watch 15-20-minute videos. Because this period spent interacting with your brand is longer, they expect to receive more factual content, including:</li></ul><p>    - Comparisons between different brands</p><p>	- Objective pros/cons for each product</p><p>	- Actual trials and testing</p><p>Also, don’t forget that you need to:</p><ul><li>Use specific hashtags to make sure that your content reaches people.</li><li>Tell people what to post about your brand.</li></ul><p>Here’s what you can infer from all of these things.</p><p><strong>Although you have little control over UGC compared to a campaign using influencers or brand ambassadors, you still have to enforce a <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/ugc-marketing-an-ultimate-guide-to-leverage-user-generated-content/">well-thought strategy</a>.</strong></p><p>That sounds like a paradox, doesn’t it?</p><p><strong>But there’s an art to planning for the unplanned.</strong> User-generated content platforms, such as <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/ugc-platform/">inBeat</a>, can help you create efficient, hassle-free UGC campaigns.</p>
