That way, you can reach your audience seamlessly.</li><li>Influencers tell your brand’s story. Thus, they can transform your brand into a relatable entity so that more people will connect and engage with it. Besides, storytelling leads to increased brand recall and customer loyalty.</li><li>Influencers can educate your audience. When marketing such a sensitive product as cannabidiol, you need to analyze its pros and cons openly. These cons include possible adverse effects. Conversely, influencers are trustworthy and relatable. They can pierce through the current rhetoric to ensure your customers get the whole story.</li></ol><h3 id="add-pr-to-the-mix">Add PR to the Mix</h3><p>If you want to reap all the advantages above, you’ll have to put together a sound plan. Often, that means adding PR to the mix.</p><p>Here’s why:</p><p>PR isn’t limited to a catchy slogan or jingly tune. Public relations efforts build transparency around your brand. Thus, you’ll become a credible and trustworthy partner for your customers.</p><p>Besides, PR can go around common advertising laws that are a problem, particularly for CBD brands.</p><blockquote>Remember:<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emarketer.com/content/influencers-more-likely-to-inspire-gen-zer-and-millennial-purchases&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1617959048293000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0lu16YQ62vNfDVRcPISxzL"> </a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.emarketer.com/content/influencers-more-likely-to-inspire-gen-zer-and-millennial-purchases&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1617959048294000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0tzhl0BqUUt48XdCm_N3_c">50% of Gen Z-ers and Millennials</a> buy products recommended by influencers.</blockquote><h2 id="the-risks-of-influencer-marketing-for-cbd-brands">The Risks of Influencer Marketing for CBD Brands</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BoelA5VFVvCkBrSaTAh2bT0d5W0RnEUlAhuZAgJx8fhHz9qVSHM12etBL7IGV5MOO1AkjjL0PB-zE2UUpegT07mfECqbDOuR7uCl6kZVxwjHQZvTCub15R5RYLtMvW4JYc4PxuFf" class="kg-image"></figure><p>Before moving forward, let’s review some risks of influencer marketing for CBD brands.</p><p>This subject is sore because CBD has medicinal uses. So, you need trustworthy influencers with a reliable background in this area. Ideally, you’d look for medical experts such as medical journalists or even physicians. Influencers who are continually researching and practicing healthy living are reliable options as well.</p><p>What happens if you choose the wrong influencer?</p><p>Your entire marketing effort will spiral into an abyss that doesn’t stare back. Nietzsche would be proud.</p><blockquote>Joke aside, selecting the wrong people means losing credibility and money, plus the very high possibility of never recovering.</blockquote><p><strong>But here’s another risk:</strong></p><p>Some states and platforms don’t allow CBD-related content. Ask your legal team to research all these restrictions because otherwise, you’ll face legal consequences.</p><p>For instance, did you know that California-based cannabis brands can’t highlight any health benefits on their packaging?</p><p>Thus, the crucial question is:</p><p><strong>Is it legal to hire influencers that promote CBD products?</strong></p><p>The short answer is yes, but you want to be careful about how your influencers discuss your products. Luckily, Facebook, Insta, and YouTube don’t prohibit CBD marketing. Phew!</p><p>Now, all you have to do is choose the right influencers.</p><h3 id="choose-the-right-influencers">Choose the Right Influencers</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JKIB1jfg4p2uSAo07v5KTgftNQqozY2eqvoGwkt2gObrMu0oT9xgnjovSRAVBtkFT0GMDV0RJBFBDXo5yWqLCp70yJmdDkmLXjNv1RP3WDz9yaPC3tmGumoBr1GmFrO7YRddu0Xc" class="kg-image"></figure><p>You want influencers that can create thumb-stopping content that sells.

Here’s how:</p><ul><li>Ensure your influencer has a focused target with whom they interact</li><li>Ask them to show people how your CBD products work (how-to videos, before-and-after stories, etc.)</li><li>Produce content that talks about side-effects as well as advantages</li></ul><h3 id="how-do-you-find-cbd-influencers">How do you find CBD influencers?</h3><ul><li>Use the influencer search tool on Instagram.</li><li>Manually <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/finding-instagram-influencers-free/">search for influencers</a> using relevant CBD hashtags such as #cbdskincare or #cbdpainmanagement.
