So it aims at creating awareness and advertising its products or services online to potential customers. The brand pays affiliate only for customers who take a predefined action on the brand's website.</li><li><strong>The affiliate </strong>who promotes the products online using various methods. For example, by placing links on their blogs and websites. Some affiliates post on social media, forums, communities, emails, videos, and podcasts. There are also affiliate networks that act as intermediaries between the brand and affiliates. Most affiliate networks charge annual fees to the brands to get access to their database of affiliates.</li><li><strong>The customer </strong>visits the affiliate website, YouTube channel, blog, or sees the social media post. He/ she uses a promo code or clicks on the link and then takes action on the brand's website. It can be an online purchase, a subscription, or a contact form.</li></ol><p><strong>To track online sales, </strong>brands use unique promo codes or a special affiliate software, like Post Affiliate Pro or Tracking Pixel.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-affiliate-and-influencer-marketing">What Is The Difference Between Affiliate and Influencer Marketing?</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/influencer-marketing-vs-affiliate-marketing.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Influencer Marketing vs Affiliate Marketing</figcaption></figure><p>Affiliate and influencer marketing overlap in quite a few areas, but have specific differences. </p><p>Let's look at them:</p><p><strong>Who are Influencers and Affiliates?</strong></p><ul><li>Most influencers are bloggers, celebrities, and media personalities.</li><li>Affiliates can be companies, publishers, and sometimes bloggers too.</li></ul><p><strong>Goals of Affiliate and Influencer Marketing:</strong></p><ul><li>Influencers create brand awareness and drive engagement among their target audience.</li><li>Affiliate marketing aims at generating leads and driving revenues.</li></ul><p><strong>Marketing Tools and Mediums</strong></p><ul><li>Influencers are using social media as a primary channel to engage with their audiences and to promote products.</li><li>Affiliates, in most cases, use websites that target the same niche as the brand.
