<p>Nano-influencer marketing is rising, from an $8bn industry in 2019 to $15bn in 2022. According to Forbes, that’s because small influencers generate 22.2 more conversations weekly and are 9.8 more impactful.</p><p>So, jumping on the nano-influencer wagon is a pretty safe bet.</p><p>Read this guide as we discuss how to drive quality engagements, build relationships with experts, and leverage user-generated content to your advantage. We used lots of successful examples and also answered poignant questions in our final FAQ section.</p><p>Keep reading below!</p><h2 id="drive-quality-engagement-on-social-media">Drive Quality Engagement On Social Media</h2><p>Do you know that advice you get in college classes about making your brand more human - personifying your brand - so that people can engage better with it?</p><p><strong>Well, nano-influencers are real human beings, and they represent your brand.</strong> As a result, your target audience will have a real, human connection with someone who <em><strong>is</strong></em> your brand’s personification.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2021/10/Nano-influencer-contetn-instagram.png" class="kg-image"></figure><p>That connection breeds all sorts of emotions: trust, appreciation, and love are just a few. Thus, a high level of engagement can foster loyal followers.</p><p>In turn, those loyal followers will:</p><ul><li>Buy your products preferentially</li><li>Create user-generated content that will assist your future campaigns</li><li>Recommend your product to their friends and family</li><li>Defend your product/ brand when things get tough</li></ul><p>And it all starts from a well-thought nano-influencer campaign.</p><p><strong><strong>Pro tip: Businesses shouldn’t have just that goal of increasing the engagement rate.</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll probably contend yourself with likes, shares, comments, and reposts if you do that. True enough, these are common indicators that measure an engagement campaign’s or an awareness campaign’s success.</p><p>Still, remember that you have to think at a larger scale than that.</p><p>A savvy nano-influencer can produce a massive buzz on social media. Your target audience might be pushed to talk about your brand and share things about it.</p><p><strong>Up until this point, the nano-influencer was your brand’s face. Now’s the time to separate the two.</strong></p><p>And the only way to see if that level of engagement determined loyal followers or not is to check if people are purchasing your products.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong></p><ul><li>Aim to increase sales at some point, even if it’s not through <em>this</em> campaign.</li><li>Use accurate KPIs to measure success.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2021/10/2nano-influencer-wildfang.png" class="kg-image"></figure><h2 id="user-generated-content-at-scale">User-Generated Content at Scale</h2><p>Nano-influencers can promote and accelerate the creation of user-generated content. Here’s how that goes:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>You hire influencers for a specific campaign.</strong> </strong>Of course, you’ve vetted everyone and chosen people that suit your brand’s personality and image.</li><li><strong><strong>Your marketing team/ agency sets rules and objectives. </strong></strong>They’ll decide on the content goal, type of content, and so forth.</li><li><strong><strong>The influencers personalize and publish content related to your brand. </strong></strong>Their messages should trigger a reaction from your target audience – intrigue them, amaze them, make them question their reality, or create a sense of community.</li></ol><p>Let’s stop this list for now and see some excellent examples of how nano-influencers can achieve that:</p><p><strong><strong>Mogo.ca </strong></strong>is a finance app that inBeat helped promote. One of our strategies was to get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CarterSullivan/search?query=mogo">Carter Sullivan</a> to present this app because she’s exactly like Mogo’s target audience:</p><ul><li>Young</li><li>Organized</li><li>Empowered</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2021/10/1Mogo-influencer-marketing-youtube.png" class="kg-image"></figure><p>Her video posts helped Millennials and Gen Z-ers see themselves in a new light. Her messages triggered a reaction and determined increased purchase decisions because:</p><ul><li><strong>Mogo became its audience’s supporter</strong>, dispelling the bias against young people who aren’t mindful of their finances.</li><li><strong>Mogo empowered people with concrete tools</strong> to mind their finances. Mogo showed it trusts its customers and actively helped them make a 180ᵒ lifestyle change that benefits them.</li></ul><p>Now we can resume our list with the final essential step:</p><p><strong>4. Your content marketing campaign will mobilize customers, so they’ll start posting quality content</strong> regarding your brand. That content can be:</p><ul><li>Part of a contest you’re organizing</li><li>Reviews</li><li>Photos of them using your products</li><li>Using your brand’s hashtags</li></ul><p>These types of UGC show different dimensions of the connection you’ve created with your target audience. For example:</p><ul><li>Using your hashtags highlights a sense of community. Your loyal customers have appropriated the community’s language and mindset.</li><li>Writing reviews shows trust.</li><li>Posting photos/ videos of your brand show legitimate pride and self-actualization.</li></ul><h2 id="build-strong-relationship-with-niche-experts">Build Strong Relationship with Niche Experts</h2><p>Use niche experts in your nano-influencer campaign because:</p><ul><li>They’re more credible.</li><li>They personify your brand better.</li><li>They can trigger more engagement.</li><li>They can actively help build a community.</li><li>Your customers look up to them and want to be like them.</li></ul><p>Look back at Mogo’s Carter Sullivan, but also North Face’s brand ambassadors or Maybelline Girls. We’ve covered more examples <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/brand-ambassador-program-examples/">here</a>, which emphasize one thing:</p><p>Building a stronger relationship with your social media influencers is essential.<strong> Here’s why and how you can do it:</strong></p><p><strong><strong>That’s how you get nano-influencers to produce more inspiring content</strong></strong></p><p>If your relationship is cold, your brand ambassador can respect your content marketing strategies and the contract you have, but the content they produce will be bland. However, the influencer will come up with unique insights regarding your brand if:</p><ul><li>You send them your products to test out.</li><li>You constantly ask for their opinion/ feedback.</li><li>You use those insights in your future marketing campaigns or product development. After all, those influencers are actually experts.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2021/10/bhs-gif.gif" class="kg-image"></figure><p><strong><strong>You motivate influencers into posting more often.</strong></strong></p><p>Sometimes nano-influences slack off, even if they’re industry experts. So fewer posts and far in between will mess up your content marketing strategy, which ends up messing with your sales funnel and, ultimately, your ROI.</p><p>So:</p><ul><li><strong>Use specific programs</strong> that keep track of your influencers and motivate them. <a href="https://www.crewfire.com/">CrewFire</a> is a good example, but you can find many more.</li><li><strong>Connect with them often</strong> – message, call, or visit each other, but make sure you’re touching base.<strong>Use gamification and rewards.</strong> Monetary incentives work well, but so do incentives like recognition and appreciation. E.g., inviting your influencers to exclusive events, shout-outs on social media, publishing photos with them, etc.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>These relationships lead to long-term partnerships.</strong></strong></p><p>Long-term partnerships with industry experts are essential because they’ll support your brand for longer. People will be confused if you constantly change nano-influencers, <em>and </em>your business will seem less dependable.</p><p><strong><strong>Besides, a constant expert figure that publishes consistent messages is essential to change deeply rooted behaviors or attitudes.</strong> </strong>Sometimes, drilling these messages into your audience is vital to building your brand up as an authentic alternative to the competition.</p><p>Take, for example:</p><ul><li>Sensitive matters like menstruation</li><li>Deeply ingrained habits like smoking or exercising</li><li>Political issues</li></ul><p>So if you’re selling menstruation underwear, organic vegan food, or fitness services – you need that long-term partnership. If you’re <em><strong>not</strong></em><strong> </strong>selling these things but follow a political or habit-changing approach, you’re going to need those long-term partnerships as well.</p><h2 id="better-return-on-investment-lower-cpas">Better Return on Investment, Lower CPAs</h2><p>Statistics all over the web show that using nano-influencers is the most cost-effective advertising solution to attract potential customers.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200526005058/en/Matter-Survey-Reveals-Consumers-Find-Influencers-More-Helpful-and-Trustworthy-than-Brands-During-the-Pandemic">61% of people</a><strong> </strong>trust influencers more than the messages coming directly from your brand.</li><li><a href="https://www.curemedia.com/influencer-marketing-statistics/">60% of people</a><strong> </strong>have made purchase decisions based on these recommendations at least once.</li><li>Nano-influencers boast the <a href="https://hypeauditor.com/whitepapers/state-of-influencer-marketing-2021">highest engagement rates of 5%</a>.This marketing strategy can trigger explosive growth between <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-2019-benchmark-report/">$5.20 and $18 for every dollar</a> you spend on your nano-influencer campaign.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2021/10/Nano-influencer-marketing.gif" class="kg-image"></figure><p><strong><strong>Remember: A social media campaign using nano-influencers is still a campaign.</strong> </strong>Thus, you have to organize it carefully, plan it to the last detail, and ensure your influencers receive some payment.</p><p>After all, they <em>are</em> experts, and you <em>are</em> hiring them with a contract and all the other stuff. But the thing is, nano-influencers have lower CPAs than micro-influencers or macro-influencers.</p><p><strong><strong>Why would that happen?</strong></strong></p><p>After all, they get the most massive engagement rates – don’t they know to ask for more money from you?</p><p>The <a href="https://hypeauditor.com/whitepapers/state-of-influencer-marketing-2021">same stats</a> show that micro-influencers are more in demand than nano-influencers because they can connect to a larger pool of people. So even if they do have a lower engagement rate, they ultimately engage more customers.</p><p>Thus: <a href="https://later.com/blog/instagram-influencer-marketing">More prominent influencers charge $1000+/ post</a>; micro-influencers ask for around $300, but nano-influencers charge much less than that.</p><h2 id="get-traffic-through-affiliate-links">Get Traffic Through Affiliate Links</h2><p>Nano-influencers will get more traffic to your website through their affiliate links. And if you play things right, more traffic generates more sales.</p><p>Here’s how it goes:</p><ul><li>The influencer makes an Instagram post about your brand.</li><li>They include an affiliate marketing link with a specific discount for social media users who click on that link.</li><li>Nano-influencers get affiliate commissions based on the clicks they get from users. Alternatively, you can decide to pay the influencer only when people have bought your products using their links.</li></ul><p>This method has many advantages:</p><ul><li> You know exactly how many conversions you have and from whom.</li><li>You can measure each influencer’s results easily.</li><li>You can correct punctual communication errors by an influencer or decide which relationship to discontinue.</li><li>The influencers have to work harder to get those commissions, but they’re also satisfied with being rewarded accordingly to their efforts. Thus, there are fewer chances that your influencers feel wronged.</li></ul><h2 id="genuine-interaction-between-your-brand-and-audience">Genuine Interaction Between your Brand and Audience</h2><p>This article concludes that nano-influencers can determine a genuine interaction between your brand and your audience. People have become almost immune to traditional advertising because it doesn’t seem honest; the sale-buy contract is always the elephant in the room, even if companies mask it with specific and costly messages.</p><p>However, social media posts from real people do seem genuine.</p><p>And as a result, they can trigger a higher engagement rate that leads to increased sales with time.</p><p>Nano-influencers have the highest engagement rates, even if their audience size is the smallest at a maximum of 5,000 followers. For example, Instagram nano-influencers have a 7.2% engagement rate. This rate is averaging 5% but varies according to the channel you’re choosing.</p><p>Of course, you will have to choose your influencers carefully according to your customers’ and brand’s profile, values, language, and so forth.</p><h3 id="what-is-considered-a-nano-influencer"><strong>What is considered a nano-influencer?</strong></h3><p>Nano-influencers have a smaller follower count of up to 10,000. They’re almost like everyday people. By contrast:</p><ul><li><strong>Micro-influencers:</strong> 10,000-20,000 followers</li><li><strong>Mid-tier influencers: </strong>20,000-100,000 followers</li><li><strong>Macro-influencers: </strong>100,000-1m followers</li><li><strong>Mega influencers and celebs:</strong> 1m+ followers</li></ul><h3 id="how-to-leverage-nano-influencers-for-influencer-marketing"><strong>How to Leverage Nano Influencers for Influencer Marketing</strong></h3><p>You can leverage nano influencers in two main ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Ask them for insights and feedback.</strong> That way, you can grow your brand and improve your influencer marketing strategy to attract more potential customers.</li><li><strong>Encourage them to ask your target audience for user-generated content. </strong>As a result, you can create more engagement, buzz, and a more invested brand community.</li></ul><h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-working-with-nano-influencers"><strong>What Are the Benefits of Working with Nano-Influencers?</strong></h3><p>The benefits of working with nano-influencers are:</p><ul><li>Producing more genuine content</li><li>A higher engagement rate that increases your sales</li><li>A scalable process if you’re using good KPIs</li></ul><h3 id="how-much-should-you-pay-for-nano-influencer-collaboration"><strong>How Much Should You Pay for Nano-Influencer Collaboration?</strong></h3><p>Nano-influencers rates vary depending on that influencer’s experience, the number of followers, and your expectations.
