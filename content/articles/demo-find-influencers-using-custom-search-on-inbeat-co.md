<p>In this demo, I will walk you through our new custom influencer search feature and share some tips on <strong>how to find influencers on Instagram</strong> in your niche and location. </p><p>Login to inBeat.co and click on New Search. Select Instagram Search: </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/influencer-search-engine-custom-search-demo-1.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Custom Influencer Search on Instagram"></figure><p>Select client. You can always click on "manage client accounts" at the bottom of the drop-down list to create a new client account. Then name your list: </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/custom-search-demo-create-a-list.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Find Influencer Similar Profiles"></figure><p>Enter the number of influencers you would like to find. Note: the more influencers you want to find, the more profiles you will need to provide for the custom search later on. </p><blockquote>For example, if you would like to discover 100 influencers, you will have to provide two or more profiles; for 300 influencers, five or more profiles, 1000 influencers, 17 or more profiles, etc. </blockquote><p>Click next:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/custom-campaign-demo-add-number.gif" class="kg-image" alt="How to find influencers on Instagram using similar profiles"></figure><p>Enter the minimum and maximum follower count. This information is optional but highly recommended if you are targeting influencers with a specific follower count:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/custom-campaign-demo-follower-count.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Find instagram influencers using inBeat custom search "></figure><p>Enter other details, such as Location and Language. Tip: the Â location filter only identifies influencer's country if they have used a location in any past posts (not all influencers do that). It can affect the number of results you will get from the custom search. </p><blockquote><strong>We recommend using Language</strong> as a filter instead of location, then go manually through the profiles and remove those that are not in your target location:</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/custom-campaign-demo-choose-language.gif" class="kg-image"></figure><p>Then you enter sample profiles for the custom search. Don't know where to find sample profiles? You can <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/finding-instagram-influencers-free/">find them on Instagram </a>manually or <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/using-inbeat/">use inBeat</a> to find them in bulk. Then click Next, confirm and run search: </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/custom-campaign-demo-add-profiles.gif" class="kg-image"></figure><p>Check back in a few hours to get the results. You can use the same filters to sort your influencers as in the regular inBeat.co search: </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/custom-campaign-demo-final-list.gif" class="kg-image"></figure><p><a href="mailto:david@inbeat.co">Let us know</a> your feedback about custom search feature!
