<p>User-generated content is the new hype in the marketing world. Brands and companies all over the globe are using it successfully to increase their revenue and decrease their advertising costs.</p><p>UGC is shown to increase engagement, raise awareness, and generate more sales.</p><p>But why should you use Instagram, and how do you create a <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/ugc-marketing-an-ultimate-guide-to-leverage-user-generated-content/">UGC strategy</a> for this channel? Read along to find out.</p><h2 id="what-is-user-generated-content">What is User-Generated Content?</h2><p>So, <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/what-is-ugc/">what is user-generated content</a>? User-generated content is a pretty self-explanatory concept: any content created by your brand’s users, aka your customers. These regular people post things about your company which you can then incorporate into your content strategies.</p><p>This authentic content includes:</p><ul><li>Images</li><li>Videos</li><li>Text</li><li>Reviews</li><li>And so forth</li></ul><p>Sharing these things on your social media accounts, e-mail marketing, and ads will increase your credibility because–and here’s a real shocker–<a href="https://adage.com/article/media/marketers-media-trusts/298221">people haven’t been trusting brand-created ads</a> for a long time.</p><p>If you decide to harness the power of user-generated content, don’t forget to pick the best strategies.</p><h2 id="why-use-user-generated-content-on-instagram">Why Use User-Generated Content on Instagram?</h2><p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/user-generated-content">UGC on Instagram works</a>, and that reason is enough to include it in your content strategies. Increasingly more companies and brands are using Instagram UGC because:</p><ul><li>It’s affordable.</li><li>You can browse through a variety of fresh content created by your audiences. Thus, you can pick the right things to post so that you can reach audiences you had not considered before.</li><li>Instagram is proven to create tight-knit communities that rally around an idea or adopt emerging trends.</li></ul><p>But here’s another thing: <strong>visual content posted on Instagram has several benefits compared to written text.</strong></p><p><strong>Visual content is more convincing, and that’s why it sparks customer trust. </strong>We won’t take you through all the rhetoric studies about that subject, but the gist is that written content relies on arguments. Once you read a sentence, you can always try to find a reason against it.</p><p>Conversely, visual content short-circuits your brain’s instinct of finding counterarguments.</p><p>Take these fantastic posts about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVRk55YFyuR/">REI</a>.</p><p>You can’t possibly argue with pictures of people smiling on mountaintops who write about loving autumn or nature. But their smiling faces, their pride, strength, connection with their loved ones. All those things will have a significant impact on your mind.</p><p>Because your brain can’t argue with images, it will automatically link REI with these feelings.</p><p>Then, you’ll also want to experience those feelings, and then you’re more likely to choose REI instead of another brand.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P5zTSM8HPs90XMWxpSdAgLI0Lzk-SuL6b-Z1zUEvA3r29NUbGBTuWTU3-ezedI4UWj1E4TX1Gq36HMoZRASBvTlLN9hMcyeyUTLzJtilsMLfRewiHDoA4hvuCrAaKdEXh92iSrPU" class="kg-image" alt="User-generated content from REI’s Instagram showing a man running on a mountain with a stunning scenery."><figcaption><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRfWQ1uBSfD/">User-generated content from REI’s Instagram</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong><strong>Visual content also creates tighter communities.</strong></strong></p><p>Sure, you can bring a ton of arguments about tight-knit communities created around significant ideas throughout history. After all, Instagram wasn’t there when the 1789 revolution started around the world.</p><p>And we’re not arguing with the written word’s power to create those communities; it’s just that pictures and videos take this thing one step further.</p><p><strong>Imagine you’re in back high school.</strong></p><p>Some students pretend to be geeks, but one look at them instantly tells you they’re not. Others pretend to love heavy metal, but again, you get who’s really into that music just by looking at them.</p><p>The point is Instagram can create the same sense of belongingness because it shows you your community.</p><p>At this point, you can quickly jump in and be part of that tribe <em>if</em> the brand incorporates your values and philosophy. Therefore, marketers need to use the power of UGC social media posts to:</p><ul><li>Associate their brand with a particular feeling</li><li>Create a tight-knit tribe</li></ul><p>Want to find out more about how to use Instagram’s algorithm to create that tribe? Look at this article <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/8-tips-to-master-instagrams-algorithm-in-2021/">here</a>.</p><p>Besides, you can use UGC for all your social media goals to drive engagement and increase your sales:</p><ul><li>You can raise awareness of your brand or your product by featuring UGC that shows how people use your products.</li><li>You can inspire brand loyalty by organizing monthly competitions.</li><li>You can open up to new markets. By giving real people that buy your products the chance to tell their <em>real stories</em>, you can connect authentically to whole new audiences.</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that people who use Instagram the most now, aka <a href="https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/communications-division/digital-communications-team/assets/documents/guides/A-Guide-To-Social-Media-Platforms-and-Demographics.pdf">Millennials and Gen-Z</a>:</p><ul><li>Have significant purchasing power</li><li>Spend at least 30% of their online time interacting with UGC</li><li><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190220005302/en/Stackla-Survey-Reveals-Disconnect-Content-Consumers-Marketers">Purchase</a> according to UGC</li></ul><h2 id="build-a-content-library-thanks-to-ugc">Build a Content Library Thanks to UGC</h2><p>Now you know why user-generated content on Instagram can help your business flourish. Let’s see how you can do that.</p><h3 id="create-relations-with-customers"><strong>Create Relations with Customers</strong></h3><p>Happy customers will write in-depth and insightful reviews about your brand. You can then repurpose these customer reviews on Instagram to achieve your goals.</p><p>For instance, you can:</p><ul><li>Post Instagram stories with customer testimonials.</li><li>Showcase real people using your products to raise awareness or create desire.</li><li>Bring out an entirely new facet of your brand by sharing unique insights.</li></ul><p>The problem now is how to encourage customers to create user-generated content.</p><p>Some solutions include:</p><ul><li><strong>Arranging competitions or contests.</strong> According to UGC statistics, social recognition rewards motivate people. Sure, objective incentives like money or products motivate them too, but internal motivation wins the jackpot. As a result, you’ll encourage unique content creation on a specific subject so you’ll reach your campaign goals easily.</li><li><strong>Promising recognition.</strong> For example, tell people you’ll feature their reviews in your e-mail marketing campaign, on your websites, or on Instagram.</li><li><strong>Showing people you care.</strong> If you make a habit of mentioning real users on your Instagram account, it will encourage others to post things.</li></ul><h3 id="collaborate-with-influencers">Collaborate With Influencers</h3><p>Your user-generated strategy can include working with influencers, although influencer-created content isn’t the same as UGC. If you decide to collaborate with influencers, you’ll have to <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/influencer-agreement-template-2/">set up contracts</a> and outline the specifics so that your influencers will post according to your requirements.</p><p><strong><strong>User-generated content is less constrained.</strong></strong></p><p>Here, content creators are real people who post because they’re motivated by social media contests, recognition, etc. On the other hand, influencers need more directives and real incentives.</p><p>Besides, your collaboration with a specific influencer will probably stretch on a more extended period, and their content will be more professional.</p><p>But here’s the thing:</p><p><strong>Sometimes UGC and influencer-created content are difficult to distinguish.</strong> Influencers are people, too; they can post things about brands they love if other contracts do not constrain them.</p><p>The point is, you can always connect to these influencers using specific platforms like the <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/demo-find-influencers-using-custom-search-on-inbeat-co/">free inBeat tool</a>.</p><h3 id="create-a-community-within-your-brand">Create a Community Within Your Brand</h3><p>We have already discussed how Instagram can create tight-knit communities we like to call tribes. This word is compelling because it clearly defines the insiders <strong>and</strong> the outsiders.</p><p>That’s the point about brand communities or tribes.</p><p>People don’t aim to be part of a specific community just for the sake of those personal connections with similar individuals; they also need a strong differentiation between them and the outsiders.</p><p>So, how can you use your creative efforts to build an engaged community?</p><p>You can create those emotional connections if you:</p><ul><li>Reply to all direct messages and comments.</li><li>Post regularly to stay top of mind, particularly during prime-time.</li><li>Use Instagram hashtags so that people can find you faster.</li></ul><p>But the bottom line is that you can build that online community if you treat everyone like family.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/y_hCfjR4v5zZTk_Tj-rNz7MfSt7H44DNK2kDSXQQz5qEQQeOltAPJxVWd5NkncW049JLSBfcrzVeDVFst5W6MwjFscWmvNxpcTik9Wr2uU0IYqag4TWgAiVv4it7pfB3sPKe226P" class="kg-image" alt="Different Instagram icons: likes, comments, DMs, followers and saved content."><figcaption><a href="https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/2557420-like-comment-share-save-admin-user-icons-for-social-media-networking-interface-icons-set-for-web-and-mobile-apps-instagram">Image source</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="use-hashtag-trends-to-collect-assets">Use Hashtag Trends to Collect Assets</h3><p>Hashtag trends will help you reach out to everyday people and find UGC content about your brand. Then, you can curate that content so that it fits your current campaign goals.</p><p>The best advice is to encourage people to post things about your brand using specific hashtags. That way, you can easily keep track of your content and decide what to feature on Instagram–and especially, <em>where</em> on Instagram.</p><p>For example, Whole Foods has this exceptional <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/wholefoodshaul/?hl=en">#WholeFoodsHaul</a> campaign that encourages people to post photos of their shopping carts. The brand then uses this aggregate UGC to stay top of mind.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/T_nO5KwNeVxrv-mzwuM1E8RsFNprCOYhvwRAY7g6HB_1jwbpNp-D193iWoz2tbT8r0DJU-WgagBJLAOlJS1mab16VJVupr7nrwmIAxfJgetnITXFuf91KxwH0pUr0-k_wIPPmtZz" class="kg-image" alt="An Instagram UGC post showing a Whole Foods grocery haul."><figcaption><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CER2Cb5JV0e/">Image source</a></figcaption></figure><p>This social media strategy is brilliant because:</p><ul><li><strong>People are curious by nature. </strong>They’ll want to know what others buy to quench this curiosity. Some people need more grocery ideas, while others have this inherent need to compare themselves to strangers.</li><li><strong>Disclosure encourages self-disclosure</strong>, and that’s true regardless of people’s motivations to self-disclose. Whole Foods managed to target a vast market composed of very diverse audiences. Some people will want to brag about their shopping, others want to make fun of their groceries, and others try to find support. As you can see, these people have different customer profiles. Regardless of that, Whole Foods targeted them all through this witty campaign.</li></ul><p>You can also use this social media strategy because it’s the cornerstone of a vast content library that you can repurpose anytime you need. Just make sure you’re honest about the source of that UGC.</p><h2 id="use-ugc-for-posts-stories-reels-and-ads">Use UGC for Posts, Stories, Reels, and Ads</h2><p>Once you get that user-generated content on Instagram, you need to organize it carefully. Sure, UGC gives regular people a lot of freedom, but that doesn’t mean you can let your campaign unfold by itself.</p><p>You need to stay on top of your planning and treat user-generated content in Instagram campaigns like any other campaign.</p><p><br><strong>That’s why you need a content calendar.</strong></p><p>Decide what content is worth showing off, when, and where. Crop images, do your edits and make sure you’ve created a unique and cohesive campaign.</p><p><strong>Repurposing content</strong> is an excellent idea because it’s an affordable way of attracting your target audience.</p><p>Also, use every little tool that Instagram has to offer.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/efJCfnm5Hbm8FabH5uT17tq-au19uc9rNv3uq5_uPMxj8EvRYr5T3gUPApmXTOWx0O5lkfwVtI2y8N9HXdZTt3pUgv6qBocbax7T44FBUTjw28CNmaaufjFivahM_BHZGUAXIEro" class="kg-image" alt="A smartphone showing Instagram stats and insights."><figcaption><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/-UsJoNxLaNo">Image source</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong><strong>Instagram posts</strong></strong> are excellent to keep you top of mind, particularly if you’re using a memorable hashtag. UPS’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/theupsstorecustomer/">#TheUPSStoreCustomer</a> is a perfect example because it allows customers–in this case, B2B companies–to associate themselves with your brand. They’re basically entering your brand’s family and claiming their position in your community.</p><p>However, Instagram also has other tools to drive up your conversion rates: ads, Reels, and stories.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://adespresso.com/guides/instagram-ads/why-instagram-ads/">ad recall on Instagram Ads is 2.8x higher</a> than ad recall from all other social networks. Reels will drive engagement and mobilize conversions because videos strengthen trust. Also, videos allow people to see more about your products, which increases the feeling of authenticity.</p><p>Don’t forget about Instagram stories, either. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_horse/">The Horse</a> always has the best stories that showcase its products from different angles. As such, this brand can create a feeling of immediacy and will increase desire.</p><p>Add a quick button to those feelings of urgency and desire to allow people to buy your products immediately–you’ll see those conversions sky-rocketing.</p><h2 id="how-to-scale-your-ugc-collection">How to Scale Your UGC Collection</h2><p>Once you have a UGC library on Instagram, you can scale up your campaign. Remember that this content is free, and you can repurpose it any way you need to.</p><p>For example, you can leverage UGC in your e-mail marketing strategy.</p><p><br>E-mail marketing has a lot of holes:</p><ul><li>It’s tough to increase engagement rates.</li><li>Marketers are finding it hard to motivate readers to action.</li><li>Conversions are challenging.</li><li>Creating that personal bond with your subscribers is difficult.</li></ul><p>“#Overtone and show us your creations” is an excellent <a href="https://blog.scoop.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/933d208b-5f50-4f6c-9a6f-8282f920d112.jpg">e-mail marketing example</a> because the brand encourages people to connect to the Instagram community <em>after </em>using Overtone products. Basically, the brand doesn’t promise a good product; it promises a connection. Of course, people have to purchase conditioners to become part of that community and to show off.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YI3v3cpkFxjl4vj0hSDHXeGXjKyzFyGlDV5g79GZ10xv8PNnwBujZuzR41KJlfII8KEhmfatoXjVDZWbVYs5kUdq72AoNFMpMQHRbqB7_SCnBaqX2S54dWIBmLwR_UfCth8jtofr" class="kg-image" alt="UGC Instagram content showing green hair using Overtone products."><figcaption><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ7QtFyDmz7/">Image source</a></figcaption></figure><p><br>Many other brands use e-mail marketing to promote specific Instagram contests that will bring loyal customers together.</p><p>You can use this strategy too because it allows you to connect authentically with your customers and because you can easily curate content.</p><p>Here’s another interesting strategy to try:</p><p><strong><strong>Use Instagram UGC inside your e-mails to drive up sales.</strong></strong></p><p><a href="https://hi.photoslurp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MeUndies.jpg">MeUndies</a> has the #meundiesfam under which people can post their photos, reviews, and videos all over social media. The company can repurpose some of these photos in their e-mails, giving credit to those who originally posted those pics.</p><p>This strategy works for MeUndies because it’s a breath of fresh air.</p><p>People are self-conscious about buying lingerie, and they <em>know</em> most models on lingerie ads are heavily edited. That’s why an e-mail posting regular people having fun and looking beautifully natural in their underwear can get more conversions.</p><p>Beware of best practices, though.</p><ul><li>Give credit where credit is due; mention the original creators every time.</li><li>Offer something valuable in exchange. It can be the chance to win a prize, recognition, or becoming part of a large community.</li><li>Make sure people understand what sort of content you need. Only <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160503005382/en/Offerpop-Survey-Identifies-Gaps-Consumers-Marketers-User-Generated">16% of brands</a> specify clear UGC rules because they don’t want to appear too “salesy,” even though most people want better outlines.</li><li>Try to learn something from every piece of submitted content, even if it’s not something you like. People see your brand differently than you do, so it’s important not to dismiss that perspective. Instead, use it as a learning opportunity to improve your content strategies or even your products.</li></ul><h2 id="the-importance-of-a-user-generated-content-strategy">The Importance of a User-Generated Content Strategy</h2><p>User-generated content is an excellent strategy for Instagram. Instagram users crave and interact with UGC, but more importantly, they also buy products according to UGC.</p><p>Besides, this strategy is affordable, easy to repurpose, and effective. However, you’ll need an excellent plan to make things work. UGC tools like <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/ugc-platform/">inBeat’s Creator Studio</a> can help you identify the current trends in UGC and also help you with a <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/think-differently-about-influencers/">well-thought influencer campaign</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
