<p>Studies show TikTok UGC works for the under-30 category, and that’s why many companies are incorporating TikTok in their content creation strategy.</p><p>The numbers speak for themselves:</p><ul><li><a href="https://chainstoreage.com/study-user-generated-tiktok-videos-have-strong-consumer-appeal">From the point of view of ad performance</a>, user-generated TikTok videos score:</li></ul><p>						- 8% more than brand-created TikTok videos</p><p>					   - 21% more than Facebook ads</p><p>					   - 68% more than traditional ads</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095186/tiktok-us-users-age/">TikTok users are</a>:</li></ul><p>					   - 41% 16-24 years old</p><p>					   - 66% below 30 years old</p><p>But why does UGC work on TikTok?</p><p>How can you create user-generated content on TikTok that sells?</p><p>Read below to find out.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/26xeLNIA-vIvvfKrUjWM-QmpUWxNqaCjwdSmSt3ggKNjTNgG_XnypeQ9C01_iiZKpNRdzuOcG-7ESwjA5UocsUvJNxpGMA6nnrGzccy1Xwtfcf4ieR0rN7T_t828-LpBx2Ojz6gu" class="kg-image" alt="A smartphone screen showing a TikTok profile."><figcaption>TikTok is a popular mobile app with a huge potential for influencer marketing. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/q1n1LmoL4Es">Image source</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-is-tiktok-so-performant-with-user-generated-content">Why Is TikTok So Performant With User-Generated Content?</h2><p>First, you must understand what user-generated content is, and for that, we encourage you to read our article “<a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/what-is-ugc/">What is UGC?</a>”.</p><p>And if you're not convinced about the power of user-generated content, our <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/40-ugc-stats-that-will-make-you-rethink-user-generated-content/">UGC statistics</a> article might change your mind.</p><p>After learning the basics of UGC, you’ll be able to see why it works on TikTok. Our extensive research showed two main categories of reasons.</p><h3 id="tiktok-features"><br>TikTok Features</h3><p>These features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Short videos.</strong> TikTok videos are short and sweet, so they grab your attention <em>and</em> also make you lose track of time. This short duration leaves you craving for more and thus activates your dopamine-releasing receptors when you <em>do</em> look at more videos.</li><li><strong>Lots of tools.</strong> People on TikTok are like kids in arts &amp; crafts class. They can play with music, colours, editing tools, and many more. Each time they make what they consider a perfect video, they feel rewarded—especially if others like that video too. As a result, they feel intrinsic motivation to create more videos and share their work on social platforms.</li><li><strong>Intuitive platform. </strong>People today lead stressful, hectic, work-filled lives starting at kindergarten. Western culture has ingrained this idea that you have to work hard for the things you want. In this world, TikTok uses the need for people to create beautiful things with little effort and truly understands the power of an easy win. That’s why TikTok makes engaging video content creation so intuitive.</li></ul><p><strong>Therefore, creating TikTok videos is easy, gratifying, and motivating—and so is looking at other people’s clips.</strong></p><h3 id="tiktok-users"><strong>TikTok Users</strong></h3><p>There are two types of TikTok active users:</p><ul><li><strong>Creators. </strong>These create TikTok videos to:</li></ul><p>						  - Show off their skills</p><p>						  - Show they can do a challenge better than others</p><p>						  - Get appreciation</p><p>						  - Feel like part of a community</p><ul><li><strong>Spectators. </strong>These people don’t want to become popular content creators, but they do like to:</li></ul><p>						  - Unwind after a stressful day</p><p>						  - Satisfy their curiosity</p><p>						  - Connect with like-minded people</p><p><strong><strong>Therefore, TikTok users seek connection, engagement, and light fun.</strong></strong></p><h2 id="how-does-user-generated-content-work-on-tiktok">How Does User-Generated Content Work on TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok UGC works because it targets two categories of people: the audience likely to buy your products and the audience who won’t buy them. That’s something unique compared to other advertising media that specifically targets only those potential customers.</p><p>That works because organic user-generated content creates:</p><ul><li>Trust</li><li>FOMO</li><li>Desire</li><li>Tight-knit communities</li></ul><p>If people see others like them using a specific product, they’re more likely to try it.</p><p>But here’s the thing:<br><br>Some people won’t buy your products because they are either too expensive or not suitable for them. Nevertheless, many luxury brands like <a href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/estee-lauder-joins-tiktok/">Estée Lauder</a>, <a href="https://www.glossy.co/fashion/luxury-brands-are-finally-making-headway-on-tiktok/">Gucci, Dior, Louis Vuitton</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktokforbusinesseurope.com/fr/inspiration/bmw-uk/">BMW</a> produce TikTok campaigns.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because reaching out to the masses, even those that won’t buy your products, is like activating an engine. <strong><strong>Thus, the purchasing audience gets to identify with a brand that everyone knows and loves, even if some people can’t afford it.</strong></strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2KOSh2FYt-Qefq49pOPrlYC0ltBm77zeoLaDOCY9MhUQFWx8oPRO4ibN7IF5r4EJ9RgbT5YqkWuiUZNw4vxO3lHo8GM7GotEFe916GH9ZPHf9mijGFR9sEVe-fys5qCYVMoy-rtB" class="kg-image" alt="Several examples of Estée Lauder on TikTok."><figcaption><a href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/estee-lauder-joins-tiktok/">Beauty brand Estée Lauder on TikTok</a></figcaption></figure><p><br>Compelling content that works on TikTok includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Challenges.</strong> Ask TikTok users to take part in a challenge using your products as props. That way, you can neatly create FOMO, desire, and a community. The best part of this is that more people will have to purchase your products to use them as props, so they’ll also get to see why your products are high quality.</li><li><strong>Contests. </strong>TikTok contests help people stand out and win something they’ve wanted for a long time—whether that’s recognition or a palpable prize.</li><li><strong>How-to videos. </strong>These looping videos create desire and showcase your products; plus, they’re very entertaining.</li></ul><p>Let’s look at some examples.</p><p><strong>The </strong><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/chipotlelidflip?"><strong>#ChipotleLidFlip</strong></a><strong> is a popular TikTok challenge devised by Chipotle</strong>, a Mexican restaurant. This hashtag challenge has young people showing off their skills at flipping lids over their dishes in Chipotle branches, and it works because it activates people’s:</p><ul><li>Instinct to show off</li><li>Desire for praise and recognition</li><li>Need for a community</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pa5oUEeCqHFG0U7iC-gtvJTMAdOz92NHA9jI6nrYyC0clvbdd-CycA6Me6zbe9UguUKS5hoy1D8Zzt_VtAu9oMCg5PnNT2owCIu3mm3ADmVPGuxNFXSWjx3r39o-UUSi7gUAUJYk" class="kg-image" alt="Several screenshots showing people doing the Chipotle TikTok challenge."><figcaption><a href="https://shortyawards.com/12th/chipotle-lid-flip-challenge-with-superfan-david-dobrik">Chipotle's marketing campaign was a huge success.</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong><strong>Gucci has partnered with many</strong> popular<strong> influencers to make their products more appealing for Gen-Z-ers</strong>, </strong>including <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sananas/video/6832562479445314821?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kolsquare.com%2F&amp;referer_video_id=6832562479445314821&amp;refer=embed">Sananas</a> with her 600k+ subscribers. We can include this TikTok video in the “how-to” category because:</p><ul><li>It shows people how to pull off different Gucci outfits</li><li>Why these clothes are elegant and comfortable at the same time</li></ul><p>Another example is the <a href="https://www.contiki.com/eu/en/activity/tiktok-competition/tik-tok-terms-and-conditions"><strong>Contiki TikTok Giveaway</strong></a>. It works because:</p><ul><li>They got original TikTok UGC videos that increased brand awareness and drew audience attention.</li><li>People created specific content according to the brand’s rules. This sort of social media content is easier to manage and measure than unpredictable posts/mentions.</li><li>TikTok users got what they wanted: recognition <em>and</em> the chance to win that big prize—travelling with the brand as its official content creator.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZCuOpSII6g9BUmBbJ7aIZCQqfpphGOb9v26jDPo684YQCV4RBY3WhPu-TGpIBS_iFeLucnz3oX6zbDB-Wa64EOJLRMIM1H3dtASRWnSTelrryv-0fgozV7nRgRZuEMtlGXzzmRb6" class="kg-image" alt="A screenshot from Contiki's website showing their TikTok challenge and travel giveaway."><figcaption><a href="https://www.contiki.com/eu/en/activity/tiktok-competition">Contiki TikTok holiday giveaway</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-to-use-consumers-and-influencers-to-create-content-for-your-brand"><br>How to Use Consumers and Influencers to Create Content for Your Brand?</h2><p>User-generated content for TikTok implies social selling, which works because it doesn’t feel artificial. So, real people are more likely to let their guard down and allow themselves to experience the whole plethora of feelings elicited by native content: FOMO, trust, desire, and the need to be part of a community.</p><p>But even if you’re dealing with organic content, you still have to follow some rules to ensure these TikTok videos are interesting. Here’s what you have to do:</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your audience what they need to do. </strong>To get the awesome content you need, establish clear rules first. Be as explicit as possible and don’t worry; you won’t sound “salesy.”</li><li><strong>Encourage people to use hashtags</strong> so that the content is easier to track and measure.</li><li><strong>Use incentives and a well-thought-out reward system</strong>, especially if you’re working with influencers. These people have contracts with you, so you need to ensure they respect these agreements.</li><li><strong>Engage with TikTok users</strong>; reply to comments, return likes, mention them on your website or social media accounts.</li><li><strong>Ask your influencers to stay true to their style. </strong>You don’t want to have too many special effects or super clean videos because these remind regular people of traditional ads.</li><li><strong>Keep your library of TikTok videos and repurpose them. </strong>Re-posting brand-positive videos will keep you top of mind and encourage more people to purchase your products.</li></ul><h2 id="how-to-find-influencers-on-tiktok">How to Find Influencers on TikTok?</h2><p>You can find influencers on TikTok by:</p><ul><li>Industry-specific hashtags</li><li>Searching the people who’ve mentioned you the most</li><li>Browsing your database of customers/employees</li><li>Using Google to discover the most successful influencers in your industry</li></ul><p>Alternatively, you can try <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/">inBeat.co</a>.
