<p>Influencer marketing is still discovering itself, and best practices are yet to be found.</p><p>The industry has garnered a bad rep for multiple reasons, many of which you probably know; outsized egos, spam, and FTC intervention.</p><p>Of course, <em>influencers</em> with deep entitlement make the news, giving influencer marketing that bitter taste we might associate with it.</p><p>You most likely read an article of a journalist or an agency creating a fake profile on Instagram, only to receive messages from brands and agencies (managing their client’s money) who want to collaborate for outrageous sums of money (<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/08/fake-instagram-account-earns-sponsored-influencer-money.html">here</a>, or <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/fake-instagram-influencer-followers-bots-mediakix/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic">here</a> if you want to go down the rabbit hole).</p><p><strong>This is the tip of the iceberg.</strong></p><p>A lot of <em>influencers</em> use the same tactics. However, their purpose is not to write a clickbaiting media piece by <em>exposing the hidden side of the industry</em>, but rather to be paid by brands to collaborate (arguably fraud, I would agree).</p><p>A study by <a href="https://ghostdata.io/report/Instagram_Counterfeiting_GD.pdf">Ghost Data</a> shows that 9,5% of the profiles on Instagram are fake accounts (95 million and counting as of 2018)</p><p><strong>It’s a problem.</strong></p><p>Fortunately, problems have solutions.</p><p>This cheatsheet results from internal data and know-how, which we have sharpened through thousands of collaborations.</p><p><strong>We learned some of these insights the hard way</strong>. Yes, we have paid for spam in the past - a mistake we avoid repeating.</p><p>Let’s look at what you can check to avoid falling for these traps.</p><h2 id="1-unnatural-follower-following-growth"><strong>1. Unnatural Follower / Following Growth</strong></h2><p>Unnatural follower and/or following growth typically come in two flavors: automation and purchased followers (bot farms).</p><h3 id="automation"><strong>Automation</strong></h3><p>There are many automation tools which are built on the promise of more followers. Here is how these software automate your account’s behavior:</p><ol><li>You follow a new profile</li><li>You like their last picture</li><li>You wait for 5 days</li><li>You unfollow them</li><li>Repeat 200 times a day</li></ol><p><strong>Bait n’ switch at its best.</strong></p><p>Luckily, you can flag profiles using these behaviors by looking at their follow/unfollow curve. To do so, head over to <a href="https://socialblade.com/">Social Blade</a>, and enter a profile you want to analyze.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.inbeat.co/img/avoid6.png" class="kg-image" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"></figure><p>The oscillation in the graph displays this behavior.</p><p>We can also observe that the influencer has stopped the said behavior, which probably signals that Instagram has banned his account for a few days as a warning.</p><h3 id="purchased-followers"><strong>Purchased Followers</strong></h3><p>A lot of websites specialize in <em>buying real followers for cheap</em>.</p><p>Here is what those <em>followers</em> might look like:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.inbeat.co/img/avoid4.png" class="kg-image" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/bizarre-click-farm-10000-phones-10419403">Mirror</a></figcaption></figure><p>Crazy, isn’t it? This bot farm counts over 10,000 phones.</p><p>Again, you can use Social Blade to detect purchased followers.You will typically see a spike like this one:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.inbeat.co/img/avoid8.png" class="kg-image" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"></figure><p>This influencer has gained 160,326 followers in December 2019, which is a red flag.</p><p>Be careful.</p><p>The peak could be the result of an externality such as the person appearing on television, which is something you should investigate.</p><h2 id="2-disproportionate-likes-to-followers-ratio"><strong>2. Disproportionate Likes to Followers Ratio</strong></h2><p>Some Instagram profiles participate in engagement pods (or groups) to boost their likes and comments per post.</p><p>An engagement pod is a group in which everyone will interact with each other’s content. This creates an unnatural boost in engagement.</p><p>Here is how engagement rate is calculated: <strong>likes + comments / followers.</strong></p><p>You can try around our <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/engagement-rate-calculator-instagram/">Instagram Engagement Calculator</a> for free to see if a profile has a good engagement rate.</p><p>If a profile has an engagement rate above 15%, I advise you double check their authenticity.</p><p>A high engagement is not necessarily a sign of spam, but it is definitely a warning. Take it into consideration.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->{{% protip title="Pro Tip" %}}
Before working with an influencer, ask them to share with you a screenshot of their audience insights:

Fraudulent profiles will have an uneven location distribution in their audience insights (i.e. 80% of profiles in India or Russia).
{{% /protip %}}<!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="3-fake-comments"><strong>3. Fake Comments</strong></h2><p>Engagement groups also allow for cross-commenting. The mechanic is simple: I comment on your pictures, you comment on mine.</p><p>The easiest way to recognize a fake comment distribution is to look at the follower count of the commenters.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Here is the logic: people who participate in engagement groups have a desire for follower growth, which means that they will have more followers count than your average Instagram user. If every comment on a post is done by someone with over 2000 followers, that is a significant red flag.</p><p>Influencers in these groups typically ask other members to comment on sponsored content to deliver a better engagement, and make the collaborator (the brand or the agency) happy. The reason is that sponsored posts typically get less engagement than non-promotional content, and this <em>fixes</em> the problem.</p><p>It is straight up fraud. As the industry matures, this is probably something that we will prosecute through courts of law. For now though, we just live with it.</p><h2 id="4-collaboration-overload"><strong>4. Collaboration Overload</strong></h2><p>Although this is not Instagram fraud per se, it is definitely something to vet for.</p><p>Let me explain.</p><p>Some influencers are collaborating with brands every other post.</p><p>The audience of these influencers is <em>burnt out</em>, meaning they lose trust in the influencer.</p><p><strong>It’s the sellout effect</strong>; you don’t trust people who are always selling you something.</p><p>For instance, this mother has 4 paid partnerships with 3 different brands (Goli, Suzy J, and Little Tikes) in her last 6 posts.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.inbeat.co/img/avoid2.png" class="kg-image" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"></figure><p>If you’re following her profile, you would quickly come to the conclusion that she is always promoting content, which makes her less trustworthy.</p><h1 id="5-lack-of-creative-direction"><strong>5. Lack of Creative Direction</strong></h1><p>This isn’t spam related either, but keeping an eye for this will affect your results across the board.</p><p>How?</p><p>Some influencers don’t have a relevant creative direction for your product.</p><p>Here is an example:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.inbeat.co/img/avoid1.png" class="kg-image" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"></figure><p><em>The reason why I love this anti-ageing serum is because my skin looks much more radiant and glowy after using it.</em></p><p>This is impersonal, and lacks what we seek from an influencer: personality. Dior might be behind this pre-chewed post write-up, but this kind of writing is pale, and carries no weight for your brand.</p><p><strong>Stay away from poor creativity.</strong></p>
