<p><strong>An influencer search engine</strong> is a tool to help you find the right influencers.</p><p>So why is it important to you?</p><p>For many brands, social media influencers became an integral part of their marketing strategy.</p><p>They are excellent for promoting products or services, building trust with the community, and creating awareness.</p><p>According to Business Insider,  brands will spend over <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/influencer-marketing-report">$15 billion on influencer marketing by 2022.</a></p><p>But not all influencers are created equal. They have very different buyer personas on their influence spectrum, which require particular content strategies.</p><p>Marketers spend a lot of time targeting the right influencers, yet <a href="https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20160726005961/en/536548/5/AltimeterInfographicFinal.jpg?download=1">68% of them say</a> that they struggle to find those that can offer the most significant return on the investment.</p><p></p><h2 id="why-finding-the-right-influencers-is-crucial">Why Finding The Right Influencers is Crucial?</h2><ul><li>Influencers usually specialize in a specific niche and have a particular tone of communication. It can do more harm than good if it doesn’t align with your brand’s message.</li><li>If your product or service is irrelevant to their community, both you and the influencer risk losing credibility.</li><li>You will maximize your investment return if your buyer persona is similar to the influencer’s target audience. For example, if influencer speaks to the 20-30-year-old age demographic, but the target audience for your product is 50-60-year-olds, the campaign will be fruitless.</li></ul><p></p><h2 id="why-should-you-choose-micro-influencers">Why Should You Choose Micro-Influencers?</h2><p>They have high engagement rates because their audience is really targeted. So you will reach the right people for your brand, who are more likely to buy your product or service.<br>They are building their following engagement by engagement by talking about subjects that genuinely matter to them, so they are more open to partner with brands that share their passion.<br>They are more authentic, so their audience can truly relate to them, which results in having a closer influencer-follower relationship.<br>If you are a small business on a budget, micro-influencers are more affordable, and partnering with them is cost-effective.</p><p></p><h2 id="how-to-find-tiktok-and-instagram-micro-influencers-for-free">How To Find TikTok and Instagram Micro-Influencers for Free?</h2><p>You can use social media platforms' search tools to find influencers. Tiktok search is limited to hashtags. You can't target influencers at a specific location unless the influencer is using location-specific hashtag. Filtering by follower count or engagement rates is also impossible.</p><p>Similar to <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/finding-tik-tok-influencers/">Tiktok</a>, on <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/finding-instagram-influencers-free/">Instagram, </a>you can browse influencers by hashtags.
