# Influencer Marketing Playbook

## 1.Influencer marketing made simple

Having pitched hundreds of thousands of influencers on various platforms, I have seen many businesses struggling with influencer marketing. How do some brands make it work seamlessly, while others flirt with it with no return?

In this guide, I will break down our learnings from working with over 10 000 influencers. If our philosophy or strategy is not what you’re seeking, you can skip right to [How to close influencers at scale](#).

### Encompassing Philosophy

**Lean operations**. Automate anything that is automatable, and that doesn’t undermine our service. We consistently automate big chunks of our work through a mix of software development, Zapier and Google Sheets.

**Scalability**. Scalability is at the core of every decision we make. We treat our influencer marketing process as a product. A product requires continuous improvement and does not fall prey to a *set and forget it mentality*.

**Sustainability**. We create our campaigns with the end-game in mind. We create a reusable and sustainable channel by building long-term relationships with our best performing influencers. 

**Optimizing output and lowering costs. It’s the best way we found to future proof our business.**

## 2. How to get influencer marketing working for your business?

Thinking before executing improves your chance of success. I recommend you to go through this exercise with your marketing department or any person in charge of marketing. Don’t overcomplicate the strategy. Go through the list of questions and openly discuss each one. At the end, you should have a good idea of how to make influencer marketing work.

Remember that the initial strategy is open to change. Iteration of your influencer marketing guarantees long-term success.

### 1. What part does influencer marketing play in your business?

At this stage, you want to define what you are looking to achieve through influencer marketing. 

Here are ideas to help you think this through:

* Content creation

*Decentralizing your content creation to influencers is a great way to 100x your creative pipeline. Leverage this by testing 100s of Facebook ads variation. It will also cut your professional content production costs*

* Explainer content (how-tos, tutorials)

*If your product or service is complex, this can be a great way to create video explainers for it.*

* Expanding your affiliate network.

* Brand awareness (be careful when defining this term. It is consistently used by marketers to justify a poor campaign investment).

.		

	

#### 1. Two examples IRL (In Real Life)

**You sell a DIY alarm system company.**

The product is relatively complex, given that it is not a one-off transaction and requires the buyer to set up the system themselves. 

In such a scenario, we could leverage influencer marketing by asking our influencers to create educational content, displaying how to use and install the product. 

We would target influencers that have a strong affinity with different subsets of our end-buyers (new parents, for example).

We would tweak and reuse this content in our other marketing channels (Facebook ads, email marketing, social media, affiliate partners, etc.) or in our customer onboarding.

**You sell a light, low-cost cell phone accessories**

Your product is simple, has a low COGS (Cost of goods sold), and is Instagrammable.

This opens the door for an effective spray and pray approach. In other words, we could aim to close 200+ influencers a month using quantitative filters such as engagement per post and number of followers. We would allocate little attention to brand guidelines and proper product placement.

Our goal would be to receive hundreds of monthly  posts that we can test at scale in our paid advertising mix. We would match the influencer’s audience demographics with our targeting.

We would also identify our top influencers by post-performance to send them our new products regularly.

Our endgame is an army of micro-influencers that can promote any new product we launch while creating a catalog of content for any new release for a low cost.

-

All you need to know at this stage is what you want to achieve through influencer marketing. Once you have established this, you can move on to discovering your ideal influencer.

### 2. Who is your ideal influencer?

Before finding influencers for your brand, define a) who your buyer is and b) who their typical influencer is. You probably have multiple buyer profiles. Go through this process for each buyer profile you want to target.

	

#### 1. Who is your buyer?

Here is a list of questions to help you understand your buyer:

* What is their age?

* What is their sex?

* What social media platforms do they use (Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, etc.)?

* What do they listen to (Podcasts, Youtube videos, Live Streaming, etc.)?

* What are their hobbies?

* What are their interests (Yoga, fitness, meditation, cosmetics, etc.)?

* ...

We go through this process to determine where your buyers spend their time on the Internet

#### 2. Who is your influencer?

You want to find which influencer holds influence on your customer. In most cases, this exercise is straight forward. If your brand sells kids' clothing, you will target moms who operate a blog, a Youtube channel or an Instagram page. But, if you dive a little deeper you would realize that there could be untapped opportunities such as toy reviews, kids' books, parenting tips, etc. If you target out-of-the-box opportunities, align your brand properly. You do not want your product to be out of tune with the influencer’s positioning. For example, if you promote your kids’ clothing line on a channel that reviews kids' books, you could make a donation to a foundation that is aligned with the channel’s mission and your brand values.

By defining who your customer listens to and trusts, you discover what they care about. You can leverage this information to rethink certain parts of your positioning.

### 3. Platforms and Positioning

You now know your global strategy, who your customer listens to and where they spend their time. Remember, this is a snapshot and will change based on the insights you gain from your data. 

You now want to determine 1) which platform you want to market on and 2) which influencer type you’re looking to target.

**Things to take in consideration:**

* Buyer’s trust level 

*For some buyers, Reddit will carry much more trust than Instagram. When I look for an honest product review, I type into Google "Product Name Review Reddit".*

* Type of content you want (media and format).

* Ease of outreach 

*Reaching out to people on Instagram is easier than reaching out to people on Tik Tok or on Reddit.*

* Influencer universe 

*How many influencers match your requirements*. *If your influencer pool is too small, you will have a hard time scaling.*

If you want to target multiple platforms, I advice you start with one and come back to the others later.

When you have figured out your platform of choice, explore the idea of creating a unique positioning.

**What do I mean by positioning?**

Communicate what you care about. Demonstrate that you are human, relatable, and genuine. This will open more doors than you can imagine.

A unique positioning for your brand is what makes you different and likable. For example, you could give to a charity that you genuinely care about or you could limit plastic packaging in your shipping. 

**Why emphasize your positioning?**

Being nicer to the world pays off. Making yourself more human builds goodwill. Overall you will:

* Drive more conversions

* Generate stronger endorsement

* Lower your collaboration costs

* Make the world a better place

If you want to go on without a specific positioning, you are welcomed to. You can perform influencer marketing without actually taking this into consideration.

If you think a unique positioning is a good asset for your business, I advise you to be authentic. Have your entire team sit down, pick something you gals and guys care about and execute on it. The impact will run deeper than you expect.

You can do this in a non-authentic way, but it will undermine your humanity. You can fake authenticity, but it is something I do not recommend. If your clients don’t catch it, your team will.

#### 4. Compensation & Incentives Alignment

How should you pay your influencer? That’s a question I hear a lot. Many tools try to automate this part of the process by giving you estimates of what you should pay. I wouldn’t trust these. 

Fieldwork (pitching and negotiating influencers) is what will help you define your compensation structure. Receiving a hundred responses from influencers in a certain niche with a certain follower count gives you insights on what your pricing should be. Here are some guiding principles to decide on your payout structure:

**Skin in the game?**

To avoid incentive misalignment, I advise you to make your product a core part of the compensation. You want influencers to endorse your brand as much as possible. They should have a high perceived value of what they’re promoting. If you’re product is of low value, this can be tricky.

**What type of content are you looking for?**

Are you looking for a video sponsorship or a dedicated video of your product (i.e. unboxing)? A dedicated video takes much more time than a sponsorship and should be rewarded accordingly.

**Reusable content?**

If content creation is an important part of your strategy, this part is important. Here are some questions to ask:

* Do you plan on reusing the content?

* Do you plan on modifying the content?

* If you modify the content, will you seek the influencer’s approval?

* Will you mention the influencer when reusing her or his content?

I advice you seek the influencer’s approval if you’re going to modify their work, and mention them when you repurpose their content.

**In Real Life:**

Prices will vary greatly. As you will see later, the best reflex you can develop is to always negotiate. I can’t stress this enough.

This being said, here are factors that can influence your fee:

* Niche

* Platform

* Size of Following

* Influencer’s sense of self worth

* Etc.

Defining what you want and narrowing your scope will allow you to get a deep understanding of what a specific influencer type wants. 

For instance, if you pitch 100 yoga influencers with the same filters, you will have a clear idea on how much you will pay.

Here is an example of a narrow filtering:

* Niche: Yoga

* Subscribers: 50k-150k

* Average views per video: 10k+

* Location: North America

* Type of content: Dedicated content

Narrow your scope, determine what you want in return, pitch and estimate the price you’re willing to pay.

## 3. How to close influencers at scale

When you implement your influencer marketing strategy, view it through the lens of a product development cycle.



This will give your team and you a proper framework to think about solutions and new ideas. Your process will look something like this: 

find > pitch > negotiate > close

### a. Prospect 

There are many ways to do this. We have built a tool internally to help do this part of the job. We have recently released it to the public. You can try it out [here](https://inbeat.co). There are countless tools to help you with this part of the process:

* Upfluence

* Tapfluence

* Grin

* Influencerdb.com

The reason we developed our tool is 1) we were not satisfied with the pricing of the other tools and 2) we weren’t satisfied with their functionality. We follow a *right tool right job* mentality and we are not usually not fans of tools that try to solve every problem. Nevertheless, these tools have upsides that might be relevant to your business.

You can also find influencers manually. I would not attempt this for campaigns where you pitch 200+ influencers a month. The person in charge of this job will tank your Glassdoor rating. 

Having said that, here is an efficient way to find influencers manually *"efficiently"*

##### 1. Youtube

1. **Build a list of seed keywords around the influencers you’re targeting.**

** **

Find Youtubers that appeal to your target audience, and identify their video tags and channel tags. You can use a tool such as [VidIQ](https://vidiq.com/) to identify these. Extract these channel tags and plug them into any tool that will give you keyword recommendations. We use ahrefs, but you can use Keywordtool.io or Twinword.ai, which are both great tools. Store your results in a Spreadsheet.

            2.  **Research Youtubers using your keyword list.**

Head to Youtube and start searching influencers using your keyword list. Vet them based on your filters (use VidIQ to identify metrics such as views per day). If you have basic technical knowledge, you can set up macros or use a browser scraping tool such as [data-miner.io](https://data-miner.io/). You could also document a workflow and hire a virtual assistant to do the research. The email address of almost every Youtuber is on the about page. As you go through this, add all your results to a Spreadsheet.

 

        3. Instagram

            3. **Build a list of relevant hashtags. **

Use common sense to discover your basic hashtags (i.e. "mom"). Head to [Display Purposes](https://displaypurposes.com/) and find more relevant hashtags (“momlife”, “mompower”, etc.). Store your results in a Spreadsheet. 

            4. **Research Instragramers using your keyword list.**

Head to Instagram and start searching for influencers under the hashtags you’ve identified. Add them to a Spreadsheet. Get a Chrome extension that allows you quantitative metrics such as engagement rate, follower growth, etc.

            5. **Leverage the suggested feature**

Under each profile you visit, Instagram shows you a list of similar profiles. Visit each profile you discovered in step 2 and go through the suggestions. This information is only available through the app. You can use an emulator like [BlueStacks ](https://www.bluestacks.com/)to do this task from your desktop, or you can do it using your cellphone.

        4. Other platforms

The methodology is the same for any new platform you want to use: 

1. Explore the platform

2. Evaluate how to find relevant influencers

3. Determine how to filter them

4. Create a workflow and systemize it

If you’re targeting blogs, I advise you use metrics such as [traffic](https://similarweb.com/), [DA](https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority) or [DR](https://ahrefs.com/blog/domain-rating/) to filter them. You can use [Scrapebox](http://www.scrapebox.com/) to reduce your discovery workload by 100x. Scrapebox is an awesome tool that has all the features you need to scale your blog discovery. Their Youtube channel has all the relevant information you need to get started. There is a learning curve to Scrapebox. It definitely qualifies as a technical tool.

 

    6. Pitch

Now that you have a list of influencers with their contact information, you can start pitching. The usual workflow goes like this: pitch, follow-up, negotiate, and onboard

        5. Create your email templates

            6. First pitch + introduction | *Connect with the influencer, personalize your emails, etc.*

            7. Follow-ups | *Busy life… A lot of people will respond to you on the 3rd or 4th follow-up. *

Here is an example we wrote for a client:

[INSERT IMAGE OF A PITCH]

Rewrite it to match your brand. Do not copy and paste the template, as it will affect your results.

**General Pitch Guidelines:**

* Explain your product simply (visuals work great for physical products)

* Mention your unique positioning (if you have one)

* Personalize your headline (i.e. {Channel name} <> {Your company name})

* Be funny (if you can) 

When crafting follow-ups, test different approaches.  In most cases, the influencer was too busy or didn’t relate to your messaging. Display different benefits, features or values in every follow-up you craft. 

Here are ideas you can leverage:

* Social proofing

* Single call to action

* Open-ended questions

* Tips and tricks

        6. Setup your email outreach tech stack

There are many tools you can use for this part of the workflow. We use [Mailshake](https://mailshake.com/), but here are some other tools you can look at:

* FreshCRM

* Close.com

* Zoho CRM

* Mixmax

* Lemlist

You want a tool that allows you to send personalized cold email at scale. Any tool that serves this function will be fine.

Once you’re setup and you’ve started outreaching, you will receive offers. As I mentioned earlier, you will get a feel for the general pricing of the segment you are pitching. The next logical step is to negotiate these deals and settle on your price per influencer.

    7. Negotiate

Negotiating is the best way to lower your campaign costs. Don’t be greedy. The influencer is a creative. If you undercut them to the point where you undermine their sense of worth, the quality of the content will depreciate accordingly. As marketers, we have to remember that there is a human component to influencer marketing. It is not purely transactional like Adwords is, although we secretly would like it to be. 

Your strongest leverage point is how the influencer your pitching perceives your brand.

        7. Perceived Value vs Dollar Value

The perceived value corresponds to the influencer’s evaluation of your product’s worth. The dollar value is your real dollar cost (Cost of good sold + Collaboration fee).

Leverage your brand’s perceived value. The higher the perceived value is to the influencer, the lower you can bring your collaboration’s dollar value. If your brand carries a lot of weight for the influencer (think Apple or dominating niche brands like SawStop), your dollar value will be much lower. If this is not your case, there are things you can do to tweak your perceived value:

* custom packaging 

* Shoutout of the influencer on your social accounts,

* Mention of their account in your paid advertising mix

* Giving extra product for them to make a contest with their audience

* …

When you think about building perceived value, consider the scale at which you want to do this. Custom packaging for 200 influencers can be a nightmare. The same goes for shoutouts and mentions. Make sure that your dollar cost is lower than the perceived value it brings. In some cases, you’re better off betting on your unique positioning or paying a premium on the collaboration.

**Cost per influencer = Collaboration cost + Cost of Good Sold **

There are multiple* *scenarios in which you can lower your collaboration cost.

* The influencer cares about your mission and values

* The influencer has a need and/or desire for your product

* The influencer already loves your brand

* The influencer is not swamped with requests

All these scenarios play on the notion of perceived value.

You are now negotiating and closing influencers, congratulations. The next step is to onboard the influencers who are interested in working with you. If you are scaling your influencer marketing, this will be the most important part of your process.

    8. Onboard

Automating your onboarding will save you hours of useless work. The manual alternative looks like this:

[Visual Asset showing the uselessness of back and forth email for missing information]

When managing any operation at scale, you want to (1) limit the potential for human error and (2) automate away anything that won’t affect bottom line quality.

        8. Setup your onboarding workflow. 

Here are the tools we use:

* Typeform

* Google Sheets

* HelloSign

* Zapier

*[Workflow visualization of our tools. Here is a description: Mailshake (preonboarding) > Typeform > HelloSign > Google Sheets]*

You want onboarding to be fluid. Zapier allows you to extend your automation all the way to product shipment. Here is an example of a workflow you could implement:

Onboarding > Contract sent > Contract Signed > Added to Sheets > Manually Approved by campaign manager > PO sent to e-commerce > Order received email sent to influencer

Zapier is awesome for this type of trigger based automation. I won’t explore Zapier in its fullest extent, given its many facets. [You can read more here](https://zapier.com/learn/).

**Things to take into consideration when onboarding:**

* Make sure you gather data through your form in the proper format(i.e. don’t ask for an address on a single line if you’re platform handles it with multiple fields).

* Make sure you build your automation to avoid misfiring (i.e. same email fires twice for the same influencer). You can do this by adding time delays to your triggers, or hidden columns in Google Sheets which keep track of the trigger status. 

        9. Manually vet

At this point, we have a list of vetted influencers interested in working with us. I advise you vet them manually before sealing the deal. It will save you from spammed profiles or irrelevant audiences that you might have missed. This is a quality check that takes little time and will make your process airtight.

We manage this directly in Google Sheets. The campaign manager goes over each profile and tags them as approved or rejected. We also identify the reason for rejection to help us improve our discovery process.

![image alt text](image_0.jpg)

You can now pay the influencer, ship your product and move on to tracking

    9. Track

Before blindly tracking, let’s define the importance of tracking. Marketers (myself included) get lazy when reporting is not a feature of the channel (Adwords, Facebook ads, etc.). Tracking enables you to discover hidden opportunities and cut losing bets. Here are examples of what you can uncover:

* Your product has an affinity with an audience or a country you didn’t know of.  

* An influencer positions your product using a set of benefits you’ve never explored.

* Some sub-niche is underperforming and is not matching your expectations.

In all of those cases, you gain actionable insight you can transfer to other parts of your marketing. For instance, we discovered that our product designs at Phone Loops were not appealing to multiple sub-niches we were treating as relevant buyers. We reconsidered our product design to make it more appealing to these people.

You also want to track your top performing influencers to create long-term relationships. More on this later.

The knowledge you gain from setting up the proper tracking is powerful. Here are some ideas of what you can track:

* Engagement

* Sales 

* Views

* Likes + Comments

* Influencer feedback. *You can send a form to the influencer asking them how they found the product and if they have any ideas on how to make it better. Remember, these people are hyper-creatives and can take you in directions you’ve never thought of. Think of it as crowd-sourcing your product decisions.*

* Audience feedback. *You can read the comments and see if there is constructive feedback and/or recurring questions. In most cases, addressing recurring questions in your sales process will drive up your conversion.*

 

    10. Repurposing Your Content

Assuming your agreement structure allows you to repurpose content, you should create a content library with all relevant files. This library can be shared with your team, partners, agencies, etc. It will allow you to deploy user-generated content across all of your communications. The effects are astonishing. Educating a new customer through a Youtuber’s how-to or displaying a new product through an Instagramer’s creative take will make your brand relatable.

Your role or company size does not matter; if you are reading this, your job is to enable your entire organization to leverage your off-the-press UGC. You will drive down overall creative costs and increase conversions and retention across your marketing efforts.

    11. Leveraging Your Army of Ambassadors

You have made it this far. Now it is time to reap the fruit of your hard work. Before you build your roster of influencers, you must identify your top performers

1. Identifying Your Top Influencers

Here is what this part of the process looks like for us:

1. Determine what you consider a top-performing influencer. You can use a percentile based approach to help you establish benchmarks (Excel and Google Sheets filters are perfect for this task). Look at filters that are important to you (engagement, sales, content quality, views, etc.). 

2. Identify your top influencers and invite them to a long-term collaboration.

3. Craft your long-term collaboration offer. *Here are a few questions to consider when structuring a long-term collaboration:*

    1. Do you want them to be affiliates?

    2. At which frequency do you want them to mention your product?

    3. Is there a monthly payout for them?

    4. Do you accept them working with competitors?

    5. …

Craft your offering with care and everything will be fine. In most cases, you won’t need to overthink this.

2. Utilizing Your Ambassador Network

This will depend on the type of business you operate. If you’re in the fashion industry, contacting your network of ambassadors will be most useful for every collection release. If you’re in the mobile gaming industry, you could decide on an affiliate structure and contact your network for promotions and launches.

There are many ways to leverage this. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

 

    1. Generate content and awareness for a new product release.

    2. Create themed content for a new campaign

    3. Distribute a promotion(i.e. Black Friday)

    4. Support a cause you care about 

3. Structuring Your Ambassador Program

Setup a CRM to manage your relations. We use Pipedrive, but any tool that will allow you to store contact info, lead status and todos will do. The purpose is to keep your data organized and know the status of a given campaign. 

4. Wrapping up

There you have it. This guide is well over 4000 words now. It is based on the learning of a bunch of marketing geeks on a quest to make influencer marketing understandable. Before closing, I want to mention common pitfalls of influencer marketing.

1. The Dangers of Influencer Marketing

1. Save Me From Myself

Treating influencer marketing as the savior to a failing business is a path to avoid. Betting on it to fix fundamental issues is not a solution. It will not cure a bad product or poor marketing. However, when done right, influencer marketing will empower your entire organization.

2. Hopping On the Bandwagon

When a trend emerges, you can expect marketing execs to get excited about a new buzz word to toss around the boardroom (think storytelling, viral marketing, etc.). Companies will implement this new shiny tactic, without giving it much thought. As for any marketing channel, tossing money at a broken foundation will not fix your problem. Influencer marketing is the same. Evaluate it as an interesting opportunity for your brand to leverage. Think of how it will benefit you across different channels, what goals you can expect to achieve and how you can make it viable in the long run. As with any bandwagon, people will hop on and will get off. Your goal is to make it work and stay onboard.

3. Set It And Forget It

Influencer marketing does not provide you with the same ease of deployment as Facebook ads or  Adwords. You also don’t have access to complex reporting out-of-the-box. There is a lot of legwork to do on your side and it will require dedicated resources. Keep that in mind, as it will help you gauge the channel adequately.

This is it. I have documented most of our learnings throughout this guide. I am aware that there is still a lot to learn. Influencer marketing has always existed, like storytelling and inbound always have. Their form changes, but each of these marketing strategies is born from the way humans interact, not from their sole existence. The concept of an influential person endorsing a brand has existed for a long time. The dynamics change, but the concept remains the same.
