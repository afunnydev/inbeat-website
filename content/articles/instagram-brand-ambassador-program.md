Ask yourself these questions:</p><p><strong>Who is always commenting, sharing, and liking your content?</strong></p><p>Loyal followers are the voice of your community. They mobilize others because they believe in your brand.</p><p>Here are some factors to consider:</p><ul><li>These followers have to be active on social media.</li><li>They have a natural flair for engaging others through funny or insightful content.</li><li>They’re charismatic.</li><li>Their personality is similar to your brand’s archetype.</li><li>Their followers are relevant to your brand’s audience.</li></ul><p>Hopefully, these people have a few thousand followers already. Also, check their engagement indicators, such as the number of likes, comments, and reposts.</p><p>That way, you can ensure:</p><ul><li>They’ll popularize your brand.</li><li>They’ll funnel more paying customers towards your brand.</li><li>If you’re going through a PR crisis, they can change customers’ minds about your company.</li></ul><p><strong>But there’s a problem.</strong></p><p><strong>Instagram is ripe with scams and fake accounts.</strong> Before choosing an influencer,<a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/what-to-avoid-with-influencers/"> learn what mistakes to avoid</a>.</p><p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Loyal customers become excellent brand ambassadors, even if they’re not currently influencers. For instance, <a href="https://medium.com/@igorbatko/growthstory-how-transferwise-is-building-a-new-global-financial-services-brand-96ec973a082e">Transferwise</a> is one of the <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/brand-ambassador-program-examples"><em>brand ambassador program examples</em></a> where a brand converted its users to ambassadors without orchestrating any program.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OHIxGfovbdOmgXSUeS-imv2g2Sx0iRJDZwiy8cJBMjK56GCP56pqZAplLp6vVCYLRHAXBc2AGLbQsrWKuIgzLvb8Zep4VmWLz43Pz7mI1uLgRQePJCGolg-yBEQD32oyWZOLJCLe" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Transferwise brand ambassador program</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s how you can find more brand ambassadors:</p><ul><li>Use an online platform such as<a href="http://buzzsumo.com/"> BuzzSumo</a>,<a href="https://famebit.com/"> FameBit</a>,<a href="https://onalytica.com/"> Onalytica</a>, and<a href="https://www.upfluence.com/"> Upfluence</a>.

However, this only happens when the brand is already active on social media and influencers see other viral posts or hashtags.</p><p><strong>Here’s a frequent mistake most companies make when contacting potential brand ambassadors:</strong></p><p>They talk endlessly about why their brand is excellent. Next, they start offering all sorts of freebies.</p><p>We’re not saying incentives are inherently wrong, but they can alienate valuable influencers when you’re pushing too hard. Instead, try this:</p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Ask potential brand ambassadors for feedback on your brand.</strong></strong></strong></li><li>Tell them why they’d be a valuable partner for your company.</li><li>Explain how you can help each other out. It is the part where you talk about discounts, deals, special offers, etc.</li></ul><p>Surprisingly, that’s the easy part.</p><p><strong>The hard part is to build your Instagram network.</strong> Imagine your brand ambassador program as a train. The carriages click with each other and pull in the same direction at once.</p><p>So, make sure you’re the glue that binds your community of influencers. You can organize online and offline meet-ups, but the crucial element is planning.</p><p>We’ll discuss that below. But first:</p><h3 id="what-should-you-include-in-the-brand-ambassador-agreement">What Should You Include in the Brand Ambassador Agreement?</h3><p>Your brand ambassador agreement should include:</p><ul><li><strong>Exclusive rights</strong> to prevent your brand ambassadors from advertising your competitors’ products</li><li><strong>Repurposing rights </strong>to reuse their content at anytime</li><li><strong>Expected results</strong> accompanied by precise guidelines</li><li><strong>Schedule</strong> with transparent deadlines</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Non-disclosure agreement</strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong>The approval process</strong> to make sure the influencer requests your approval before posting on Insta</li><li><strong>Legal responsibilities </strong>to clarify that you’re not liable if the influencer commits a crime while being your brand ambassador</li><li><strong>Payment procedure </strong>to specify details about payment, such as dates, quantum, and conditions</li></ul><p>You can either sign a printed document or an online one through tools like:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.docusign.com/">DocuSign</a></li><li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/sign.html">Adobe Sign</a></li><li><a href="https://www.pandadoc.com/">Pandadoc</a></li><li><a href="https://signeasy.com/">Sign Easy</a></li></ul><h3 id="how-to-create-a-fun-brand-ambassador-program-that-works">How to Create a Fun Brand Ambassador Program That Works?</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sBb2g2dzuaUdSjeoySp8cPfUlO0bxzAO4SUPZ7Ah2aQ7yJZEBp7wnPmNEejS2pd8UJB_syKf35wiHHsZAxGJQhXdYA4q6AAgcWzqZ75l2gWZhoxPYaIRQeUVk3uosxybufOrdfwd" class="kg-image" alt="Fun brand ambassador programs"></figure><p>A fun brand ambassador program that works starts with probably the least fun thing in the history of fun things, unless you’re Sheldon Cooper. And that’s planning.</p><p>Think of it like this: you want results.</p><p>But you have to know which results your company needs. That’s why you draft precise goals, strategies, instruments, deadlines, and all the other things they teach in marketing school. We bet you also know how to define your audience, how to make a SWAT analysis, and how to assess your competition.</p><p><strong>How do you make things fun?</strong></p><p>Focus on your customers’ needs and learn what motivates them. Then, keep them engaged with:</p><ul><li>Posts that raise their curiosity</li><li>Inspiring stories about influencers’ ups and downs, how they found their motivation</li><li>Behind-the-scenes posts. Who doesn’t want to see their idol getting out of bed with messy morning hair?</li><li>Original content from fans</li><li>Competitions, giveaways, and challenges</li><li>Polls and debates</li><li>Prizes or certificates for top followers</li><li>Sharing tips and tricks about your product</li><li>Using your product in innovative ways</li><li>Roasts</li><li>Talking about hardships and how the influencers overcame them by using your product</li><li>A day in your brand ambassador’s life</li></ul><p>Just make sure the instruments you choose are relevant for your brand and the current campaign. If they fit your strategy, they’ll bring in more results.</p><p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Don’t forget to feature these stories on your website and arrange them in categories on Instagram.</p><h3 id="how-to-get-ambassadors-to-post">How to Get Ambassadors to Post</h3><p>Brand ambassadors aren’t free, but paid influencing is still stigmatized. That means you’re walking a fine line between building credibility and becoming a company that buys its good reviews.</p><p>Monetary commissions aren’t necessary, though. You can get ambassadors to post with:</p><ul><li>Free products or discounts</li><li>Exclusive deals and tries</li><li>Gift bags or gift cards</li><li>Events and parties</li><li>Pay-per-click programs</li></ul><p>As you can see, you need to be well-organized. Google Sheets, Mail Chimp, or similar programs will help you keep track of influencers’ posts.</p><p>You can also try<a href="https://www.crewfire.com"> programs like CrewFire</a> to engage and reward your brand ambassadors.</p><p>These platforms give you all sorts of tips on how to entertain your influencers. You’ll notice various features that keep your brand ambassadors captivated, primarily through praise features and mini-rewards.</p><p><strong>However, if those dopamine-releasing tricks are your strategy’s cornerstone, you’re doing something wrong.</strong></p><p>External motivation only works to some extent. That’s why you need relevant brand ambassadors who will be loyal to your brand.</p>
