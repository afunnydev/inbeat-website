In this guide, I will go through the process of **discovering**, **pitching**, and **managing** micro-influencers at scale.

We have worked with 10 000+ micro-influencers across Instagram and Youtube throughout the life of our agency, and this is how we do things. 

> **Our process is simple:** 
>
> 1. Discover influencers
> 2. Pitch and negotiate
> 3. Onboard and manage

From my experience, working with micro-influencers is **scalable** and a **powerful** marketing channel. With the right systems in place, you can make it easy for your team to manage 100s of influencers at any given time.

This article covers **Instagram** specifically, but you can apply the same systems thinking to any channel (looking at you, Tik Tok).

*Let’s get into it.*

## Discover influencers 

There are multiple ways to discover influencers. For the sake of this article, I will show you how we do our research using **inBeat** (full disclosure: I am a co-founder, and we use this tool internally within our agency). There is a free plan, which you can use to toy around with influencer marketing. If you’re looking to do this seriously, you would benefit from a paid version.

You could also hire a virtual assistant (VA) to find influencers manually, or you could use another tool.

### Manually Finding Influencers 

> The best way to find influencers on Instagram is to **Find relevant hashtags to your product**

 *I recommend you use [Display Purposes](https://displaypurposes.com/) to simplify your research*
