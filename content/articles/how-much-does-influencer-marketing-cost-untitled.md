<p><a href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/20-influencer-marketing-statistics-that-will-surprise-you">49%</a> of consumers depend on influencer recommendations, but how <strong>much does the influencer marketing cost? </strong></p><p>Many marketers are confused about the costs of influencer marketing. There is no standard or clear line when it comes to influencer pricing. It's the wild wild west.</p><p>In this article, you will learn what to expect when budgeting for influencer marketing campaigns on different social media channels.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/how-much-influencer-marketing-cost.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>How Much Does Influencer Marketing Cost</figcaption></figure><p>The misconception about the influencer marketing is that it is expensive. This idea is far from the truth. There are different social media channels and various types of influencers. So every brand can afford an influencer marketing campaign, even with a small budget.<br></p><p>Influencer marketing is one of the best ways to connect with your potential customers on an authentic level. As a result, a successful campaign can bring you a significant ROI, meaning that your spend is outpaced by your return.</p><h2 id="what-factors-affect-influencer-pricing">What Factors Affect Influencer Pricing?</h2><p>There is no clear-cut answer to how much the influencer marketing costs, but those are the five factors that affect it:</p><p><strong>1. Social media platform.</strong> The cost of the influencer marketing varies across social media channels. Instagram is the top choice for most marketers, so prepare to spend more on Instagram than on most platforms. YouTube follows Instagram by popularity. But creating YouTube videos requires more work as they are usually longer than those on Instagram.</p><p>As a result, Influencer campaigns on YouTube cost more than on Instagram. TikTok is taking over the social media by storm, so many advertisers started to work with influencers on this channel. Brands chose Twitter and Facebook less frequently for influencer marketing.</p><p>Here is a chart from<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/19976/average-cost-of-a-sponsored-post-by-platform/"> Statista</a> that compares average influencer pricing by platform:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/influencer-marketing-costs-chart-1.jpeg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Influencer Marketing Costs Statistics by Platform</figcaption></figure><p><strong>2. Number of followers. </strong>Until recently, the number of followers determined the pricing for influencer marketing. As it became possible to buy fake followers, brands started looking at other metrics, such as engagement.</p><p>As a recent <a href="https://www.mobilemarketer.com/news/instagram-influencer-engagement-hovers-near-all-time-lows-study-says/558331/">study </a>shows, the fewer followers an influencer has, the higher their engagement rate. This explains why micro-influencer marketing is on the rise. </p><p>Micro-influencers with 5,000 to 25,000 followersoften collaborate in exchange for product.</p><p><strong>3. Scale of the influencer marketing campaign and type of content. </strong>The more work influencers do for you, the more they charge. So the cost of influencer marketing depends on the complexity of the content (cross-posting on other social media profiles, long-form video, caroussel, etc.)</p><p><strong>4. Direct partnership with an influencer or through a talent agent.</strong> You can <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/finding-instagram-influencers-free/">find influencers </a>yourself or use an agency to connect you to the right ones for your campaign. The benefit of partnering up with agencies is that they usually work with more experienced influencers. Note that you will pay a premium.</p><p><strong>5. The product you want to advertise. </strong>Both your product and the industry you are in can affect the influencer marketing costs. Collaborating with an influencer to promote a gambling app will generally cost more than to advertise a fitness gadget.</p><p>Continue reading to learn more about influencer pricing on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.</p><h2 id="how-much-does-youtube-influencer-marketing-cost">How Much Does YouTube Influencer Marketing Cost?</h2><p>As with all other social media platforms, influencer pricing on YouTube can vary. It depends on engagement, number of subscribers, content type, and the brand. </p><p>If your brand is unknown, an influencer might charge you more for putting it in front of his or her followers. Influencers often ask to try the products from unfamiliar brands before committing to collaborations.</p><p>Standing for a <strong>good cause </strong>will help you find influencers in your niche who share the same values. Protection of the environment or charity donations can significantly reduce your influencer marketing costs. </p><p>For example, when pitching YouTube influencers, you can mention that from every product sold thanks to their promotion, you will donate $10 to support education in developing countries. Use a unique promo code to track sales from a specific influencer.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, YouTube influencers follow two main pricing strategies. You can use them as a guideline when planning your marketing costs: </p><ul><li><strong>Price per subscribers. </strong>On average, prepare to pay<strong> $20 for every 1,000 subscribers</strong> of a YouTube influencer unless you have a great product or a brand that stands for something.</li><li><strong>Price per video views. </strong>Not everyone will watch every single video produced by the YouTuber. Â Thus, video views are an important metric to measure the engagement rate of the influencer. Look at the last 30-40 videos to calculate the video view rate. Price per view varies depending on the type of content. For example, an integrated video sponsorship will cost you <strong>from $40 to $70 per view.</strong> Dedicated videos range from<strong> $80 to $150 per view</strong>.</li></ul><p><br>You can also use a platform like <a href="https://famebit.com/">FameBit </a>by YouTube to have influencers reach out to you based on the budget you set. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/how-much-youtube-influencers-cost-famebeat.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>How Much Does YouTube Marketing Cost on Famebit</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-much-does-instagram-influencer-marketing-cost"><br>How Much Does Instagram Influencer Marketing Cost?</h2><p>There are several factors to take into account when calculating Instagram influencer marketing costs. Some influencers charge based on their niche, the reach, and impressions. Others use the number of followers as a guideline. </p><p>For example, @christinagalbato and other large Instagram influencers can charge <strong>$100 per 10,000 followers</strong>. So on average, an Instagram post from an influencer with 100K followers costs approximately $1000. Don't forget to negotiate, we have worked with top influencers for much cheaper than that.<br></p><p>Big Instagram influencers with 100,000+ followers come with a big price tag. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/how-much-does-instagram-influencer-marketing-cost.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>How much do Instagram Influencers cost?</figcaption></figure><p>Bigger influencers make it hard to narrow your potential customers through their vast audience. Micro-influencers are the solution to focusing your targeting.</p><p>Brands typically <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/kids-brand-influencer-marketing/">partner up </a>with <strong>micro-influencers </strong>to target their specific client<strong>. </strong></p><p>Micro-influencers specialize in a particular niche; they have personal contact with their followers, who perceive them as âpeople like me.â </p><p>Consumers are more likely to follow recommendations from someone they know and trust. So working with micro-influencers can boost your conversion rates by far. </p><p>Itâs no surprise that last year, micro-influencers accounted for <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/new-report-looks-at-the-growth-of-influencer-marketing-on-instagram/546245/">84% </a>of sponsored social media posts worldwide. Micro-influencers are more affordable than the large ones, and they deliver higher ROI per dollar spent.</p><p>Thatâs why itâs no surprise that last year, micro-influencers accounted for <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/new-report-looks-at-the-growth-of-influencer-marketing-on-instagram/546245/">84% </a>of sponsored social media posts worldwide. <br>Micro-influencers are more affordable than the large ones, and they deliver higher ROI per dollar spent.</p><h3 id="so-how-much-do-micro-influencers-charge"> <br>So How Much Do Micro-Influencers Charge?</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/how-much-micro-influencers-cost.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>How Much Do Micro-Influencers on Instagram Charge?</figcaption></figure><p>On average, micro-influencers charge from <strong>$0 to $2000 per Instagram post</strong>.

A cohort that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/deeppatel/2017/05/30/gen-z-hates-tv-and-what-that-means-for-traditional-advertising/#1c5ae8ba32ed">avoids traditional advertising. </a> For this reason, influencer marketing campaigns on TikTok generate fantastic results for brands selling to Gen Z. Â </p><p>Similar to other social media channels, influencer pricing on TikTok varies based on what the brand and the influencer consider a fair value. Â It depends on the influencerâs niche, country, engagement, and audience brand affinity. </p><p>TikTok is a relatively new platform, so influencer marketing costs on this channel are far from standardized: Â </p><ul><li>Some influencers charge a flat of Â <strong>$200 to $20,000</strong> for a branded video on TikTok.</li><li>Cost per sponsored video view ranges from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/influencer-marketing-cost-per-view-on-tiktok-compared-to-youtube-2020-1"><strong>$0,01 to $0,02</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li><li>Other TikTok influencers agree to get paid based on sales or conversion. For example, they charge per app download or per activation of a unique promo code.</li></ul><p><br>Many of the TikTok influencers have a significant presence on other social media platforms.
