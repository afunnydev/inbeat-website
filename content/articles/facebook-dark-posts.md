<p>When you first hear of Facebook dark posts, you can be a little thrown back. The term itself sounds pretty sketchy, if not downright sinister.</p><p>Should you really get yourself into it?</p><p>The answer is yes. Facebook dark posts aren’t connected to the dark web, and they’re not part of the <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/redefining-influencer-marketing-with-dark-social/">dark social</a>.</p><p>They’re something better.</p><p>These posts will help you target your audience in ways you haven’t even dreamed of. They’ll allow you customize your campaigns at lower costs, keep your organic traffic visible, and engage with your audiences at a deeper level.</p><p>This article will tell you what dark posts are, why they work, and how to use them. We’ll talk you through different optimizing techniques and also share the drawbacks.</p><p>Keep reading below!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vcydFhlWropmtTiwp_TZKP37ds1gg4djvt2bIH_YO5EA8eDsitg8WS87NoYoY8iqnCqPY3iqeQIwJWQtooIAB3YJueGrIUEY-UMHQC718JDsC0tjwO-57Us8GNEM2RKOMq-EarMI" class="kg-image" alt="A dark desk faintly illuminated by a desk lamp."><figcaption>What are Facebook dark posts? (<a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/turned-on-black-desk-lamp-on-top-of-table-923311/">Image source</a>)</figcaption></figure><h2 id="what-does-dark-post-mean-in-facebook-advertising">What Does Dark Post Mean in Facebook Advertising?</h2><p>Facebook Dark posts, aka unpublished posts, are targeted posts that:</p><ul><li>Don’t appear on your timeline and your followers’ feeds.</li><li>Appear as sponsored content in the feeds of people you’re explicitly targeting.</li></ul><p><strong>How did these dark posts become so widespread?</strong></p><p>Traditional Facebook ads face a significant issue: they lack social proof. When you create an ad using Facebook Manager, that ad gets a unique ID. That means all your ads are individual.</p><p><strong>That’s a problem if you want to target several audiences with that ad.</strong></p><p>Because each time you want to get to a new audience, you’ll have to create a new individual ad. So, if you make five posts with five unique IDs, your likes, comments, and shares are split by five.</p><p><strong>That’s not effective at all.</strong></p><p>By contrast, dark posts allow every targeted person to see all likes, comments, and shares. As such, you can build more social proof so that your potential customers are more likely to purchase your products/services.</p><p>That brings us to the next issue:</p><h2 id="why-are-dark-posts-useful"><br>Why Are Dark Posts Useful?</h2><p>Dark posts are efficient because they allow you to:</p><p><strong>1. Target Your Audience Precisely</strong></p><p>Facebook bases its traditional promotional posts on Facebook on generic variables:</p><ul><li>Age</li><li>Gender</li><li>Geographical location</li><li>Interests</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/maxVcC2a0HXobvXVfnjqG6DLPX0ONXGi7CdU9y7BVwt6t0zEVJiXV_V9LyIu0Sn99hwCFYb5YLnKmhZV-xIoUVY9bjm6hJblmP_ybdIs2Ip9QLYjW2g5Ky9FsG1ozglxObbzXJS0" class="kg-image" alt="A white board with the word &quot;Audience&quot; and arrows pointing at it."><figcaption>The best content is of no use if it doesn't reach the right audience. (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/U33fHryBYBU">Image source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>An unpublished post allows you to:</p><ul><li>Target your audience more precisely through specific keywords (e.g., a job title).</li><li>Create uniquely tailored ads for all of your audiences and segments in a specific audience; each audience/segment sees only the ad that’s designed for them.</li><li>Target all audience segments with those personalized ads simultaneously.</li></ul><p>That precise targeting has a significant impact on your ROI.</p><p><strong>2. Have more A/B Testing Options</strong></p><p>Dark posts target different audiences, meaning you can test multiple versions of the same ad to see which one gets more:</p><ul><li>Clicks</li><li>Conversions</li><li>Engagement</li></ul><p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Experiment with different ad features to optimize your dark posts (e.g., headline, action buttons, or visuals).</p><p><strong>3. Improve Other Content</strong></p><p>Once you know which ad features work best for a specific audience, you can implement those features in other posts. Let’s say you create a post, but you’re not sure about the image. You can publish two identical dark posts with two different photos, see which one performs better, and remove the other.</p><p><strong><strong>4. Prevent Spam</strong></strong></p><p>People <em><strong>hate</strong></em> spammy content, and numbers prove it: <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/74-of-people-are-tired-of-social-media-ads-but-theyre-effective/">three out of four people think there are too many ads on social media</a>.</p><p>Just picture your Facebook timeline swamped in boosted ads that look the same. Those ads would suffocate any trace of organic posts on your page.</p><p>As a result, your customers would deem your page useless and spammy.</p><p>By contrast, dark posts keep your timeline clear and don’t clog your followers’ news feeds. Facebook users want to see more posts from their friends, not brands’ ads.</p><p>So, avoid becoming annoying to keep your brand community loyal.</p><h2 id="how-do-you-use-dark-posts-for-facebook-influencer-marketing">How Do You Use Dark Posts for Facebook Influencer Marketing?</h2><p>Here’s how to leverage dark posts for your advantage, especially if you’re running an influencer marketing campaign.</p><h3 id="1-more-social-proof"><strong>1. More Social Proof</strong></h3><p>When people see a significant number of their peers appreciate a particular product/service/brand, they want it too. When you create dark posts, the accumulated likes, comments, and shares increase social proof. As a result:</p><ul><li>Your post gets more attention.</li><li>More people will interact with it.</li><li>Your conversion rates will skyrocket.</li><li>Facebook algorithm deems it high-quality, so it boosts it higher.</li></ul><p>That’s a snowball of social proof that decreases your total cost per result.</p><p>If you’re setting up an influencer marketing campaign, you can use the same influencer with slightly tweaked messages to reach more audiences. That allows better testing of different ad features at lower costs.</p><h3 id="2-simpler-campaigns"><br>2. Simpler Campaigns</h3><p>The more ads you have on Facebook, the harder they are to manage. And it’s not just about hard work either; it’s about how that glorious mess affects your decision-making capabilities. You may forget to shut down ads that don’t perform well or miss essential opportunities.</p><p>Dark posts streamline your campaigns so that you can have more control. Here’s how that translates in an influencer marketing campaign:</p><p>The more content creators you have working for you, the more complicated things are to manage. Facebook Dark Posts lessen your advertising efforts without compromising your campaign objectives.</p><h3 id="3-better-targeting"><strong>3. Better Targeting</strong></h3><p>Unpublished posts allow you to target lookalike audiences <em>and</em> very distinct groups.</p><p>To have more success, test your influencers’ messages! Even a slight tweak in lighting or colors can give a whole new meaning to your messages.</p><p>Next, use this new information to create more appealing posts for each custom audience on all platforms. Running these micro-campaigns will get you better feedback on your audience, meaning you can craft more effective messages.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xYNaig8wsvkPQ3aDZpbBIn3wVcLRyXMWLJIys9v65JZ5wRez8YnXhMM0Aq6KZPrqzJjuXkYlkDd7GrhZ1ncQIdfecrPeqdGrYZ2_M82I2HoKDIsMW2ZsaeBE4ajIotveVLHYe-Dr" class="kg-image" alt="A dart on a target."><figcaption>Dark Posts are highly useful to better target your audience.

Get Feedback</h3><p>If you’ve ever used Facebook Ads Manager, you know how difficult it is to find the right audience. However, unpublished page posts solve that issue because:</p><ul><li>You create unique feedback forms for beta testing.</li><li>You share these invites just with your select audience.</li><li>You save time and resources.</li></ul><h2 id="how-do-you-create-dark-posts"><strong>How Do You Create Dark Posts?</strong></h2><p>Creating dark posts on Facebook is a fairly straightforward process:</p><p>Go to Facebook Ads Manager. You can find this tool in the “See More” section in the left-hand side of your Facebook homepage.</p><ol><li>Open the Options &amp; Setting Menu in Facebook’s Ads Manager top left corner.</li><li>At the bottom of this menu, click on the Engage Customers section and then the Page Posts dashboard to open it.</li><li>Click on the “Create Post” button to create your first unpublished page post.</li><li>Select the post type you need and then add all the necessary content.</li><li>After uploading everything, you’ll see two options to publish this post:</li></ol><ul><li>An ad</li><li>An ad for which you can schedule the publishing time</li></ul><p>After creating the dark post on this social media platform, it will appear in your dashboard. From here on, you can choose the actions you want for this post:</p><ul><li>Publish</li><li>Schedule</li><li>Delete</li><li>Create</li><li>Ad</li></ul><p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>monitor the relevant engagement metrics.</p><h2 id="how-to-optimize-your-facebook-dark-posts">How to Optimize Your Facebook Dark Posts</h2><p>Now that you’ve created a Facebook dark post or two, let’s see how to optimize your work:</p><ul><li><strong>Review A/B tests. </strong>Of course, you’ll need to set your marketing objectives first and organize that A/B testing campaign. Luckily, even companies with limited budgets can see precise results within a day. Here’s what to follow:</li></ul><p>	- Cost per engagement if your goal is to create more engagement</p><p>	- Cost per click if you want to increase traffic</p><p>	- Cost per conversion if you set up conversion campaigns</p><ul><li><strong>Find the ad that’s performing best.</strong> Shut down the ads that cost you the most and put the remaining money towards the most efficient ad.</li></ul><p>That’s the primary way to optimize your Facebook dark posts, but you can take things further:</p><ul><li>Take that most efficient ad you’ve found in the previous step and duplicate it.</li><li>Change your audience demographics by narrowing down the interests or adding extra keywords to the mix.</li><li>Review results; record winners and delete losers.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Pro tip: These ads will trigger engagement in the shape of comments and other reactions. Reply to all those comments to speed up your potential customers’ purchasing decisions.</strong></strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jbmcPo12qM83mWbUxpAO_cdq9VYPn2_ijbKcapRqvo1RxRRBF9_-XH0rX50hN0eCMbO1NCArJAHyz2AHPhKSAGGpssJEdgM4D7cXB6u-_HXVimba9TFU6d_4zmQepVS6TeW0gQ2-" class="kg-image" alt="A person typing on an open laptop showinf a Facebook window."><figcaption>Dark posts are great for optimizing your Facebook marketing strategy. (<a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/women-typing-on-the-notebook-6168/">Image source</a>)</figcaption></figure><h2 id="dark-posts-disadvantages">Dark Posts Disadvantages</h2><p>Dark posts have some drawbacks that you should learn about before setting up your campaign:</p><ul><li><strong>You can’t edit them</strong> after you’ve created the ad. So, if you want to correct a spelling error, you’ll have to create a new post ID, and that loses all the social proof you’ve gathered with the old dark post.</li><li><strong>Tracking different campaigns and ad sets is more difficult</strong> if you hard-code UTM parameters into the link. That UTM stays with the dark post in a new campaign, which means it shows fewer leads. To solve this problem, remember to use the URL Parameters feature on Facebook to update UTM parameters throughout your campaigns.</li></ul><h2 id="in-conclusion"><strong>In Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Even with these two disadvantages above, Facebook dark posts still have significantly more benefits. Employ them in your ad campaigns, and you’ll see better results at decreased costs.</p><p>Zeroing in on your audiences increases your chances of engagement and gets you more helpful feedback from your potential customers. That starts a new cycle of improved engagement and more accurate feedback.</p><p>As a result, you’ll craft even more efficient messages that sell more products.</p><p>The problem with unpublished posts is knowing which adjustments to make. That statement is true, especially in influencer marketing, where people are your messages, but not limited to it.</p><p>That’s why the best advice is to find a trustworthy marketing agency to help you implement those dark posts.
