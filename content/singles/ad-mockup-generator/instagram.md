faq:
  - question: What is an ad mockup generator?
    answer: >-
        An ad mockup generator helps you pre-visualize your ad in real-time on every available
        placement so you can try different visuals, captions, call to action, and titles and see what fits
        best.
  - question: How does your Instagram ad mockup generator work?
    answer: >-
     Select your placement between Feed, Reel, or Story, upload your visual asset (image, carousel,
     or video), play around with the different calls to action, and copy what you want to experiment.
     You will be able to visualize your changes in real-time.
