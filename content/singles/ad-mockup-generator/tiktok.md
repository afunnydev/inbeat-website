  - question: How many seconds should a TikTok ad be?
    answer: >-
          While there is no standard length for a TikTok ad, most marketers recommend keeping it short
          and sweet. After all, the whole point of TikTok is to consume content quickly and on the go.<br>
          With that in mind, we recommend keeping your ad around 15 seconds. Any longer than that,
          and you risk losing people’s attention.

          &#x25CF; <b>Relevant content that offers value.</b> Whether that’s a discount, controversy, or just
          helpful information, make sure there’s a reason for people to stop and watch your ad.<br>
          &#x25CF; <b>A call-to-action (CTA)</b> telling people what you want them to do after watching your ad.Whether visiting your website, downloading your app, or simply following your account,make sure your CTA is clear and concise.<br>

  - question: What are the best TikTok ad design formats?
    answer: >-
        The dimensions of a TikTok ad depend on the format you choose. The recommended size is
        1080px by 1920px for video ads and 1200px by 628px for image ads.<br>
        <b>Remember:</b> People will view your ad on mobile devices, so optimize it for a small screen. Keep
        the text short and easy to read, and use high-quality visuals that are eye-catching and relevant
        to your product or service.<br>
        If you’re unsure which format is right for you, we recommend experimenting with video and
        image ads. You can always use the TikTok Ads mockup generator to create multiple versions of
        your ad and compare the results.

        having a clear call-to-action.<br>
        Formats such as in-feed, top-view, brand takeover, branded hashtag challenge, and branded
        effects seem to succeed the most.
