          &#x25CF; <b>Time it well.</b> A Snap Ad should appear at just the right moment when the user is most likely to be receptive to it.<br>
          &#x25CF; <b>Include a clear call to action.</b> The user should know exactly what they are supposed to do after viewing the ad.<br>
  - question: How long should a Snapchat ad be?
    answer: >-
        Most experts agree that shorter is better when it comes to Snapchat ads. With an attention span
        of just 8 seconds, the younger generations are known for their love of quick, concise content.
        However, this rule may have some exceptions depending on the product or service being
        advertised.<br>
        Ultimately, the best way to determine the ideal length for a Snapchat ad is to test different
        lengths and see what performs best with your target audience.

          &#x25CF; <b>Assess your budget.</b> Snapchat ads can be fairly expensive, so you’ll need to ensure
          you have enough money to fund your campaign.<br>
