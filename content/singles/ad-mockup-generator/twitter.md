faq:
  - question: What is a Twitter Ads mockup generator?
    answer: >-
          A Twitter Ads mockup generator is a tool that allows you to create different Twitter Ads versions.
          This software can be helpful if you want to edit, preview, and test several formats.
  - question: What are the benefits of using a Twitter Ads mockup generator?
    answer: >-
          A Twitter Ads mockup generator saves time and improves your results when creating Twitter
          Ads. Using a generator, you can create multiple ad versions in minutes without designing each
          one from scratch. Additionally, a mockup generator can help you make more
          professional-looking ads, improving your results. When potential customers see that your ads
          look polished and well-designed, they’re more likely to click on them.
  - question: How to use the Twitter Ads mockup generator?
    answer: >-
          Upload your text and images, then begin to edit your ads. You will find a wide menu of options
          that you can use to customize your ad. For example, you can add text, logos, and other
          elements to your ad.<br>
          Once you’re happy with your mockups, click the “Save” button, and you’re done.
  - question: What makes a great Twitter ad?
    answer: >-
          First and foremost, you need to have a clear understanding of your target audience. What are
          their interests? What kind of language do they respond to?<br>
          Once you’ve answered these questions, your copy should be concise and to the point, with a
          strong call to action. You’ll also need to choose a visually appealing and relevant image or video
          to accompany your ad.<br>
          Finally, don’t forget to include a relevant hashtag so that your ad can reach a wider audience
  - question: How long should a Twitter ad be?
    answer: >-
        If you’re selling a simple product or service, a short ad conveying your message succinctly is
        best. On the other hand, if you’re trying to build awareness for a complex campaign, you’ll need
        to take a more nuanced approach. In general, it’s best to err on the side of brevity – users have
        short attention spans and are more likely to engage with an ad that’s easy to digest.<br>
        That’s why it’s wise to test different Twitter ads before releasing your campaign.
  - question: How much does it cost to run a Twitter ad?
    answer: >-
        Twitter ads prices depend on their formats:<br>
        &#x25CF; Promoted ads cost $0.25-$2 per action<br>
        &#x25CF; Follower ads cost $2-$4 per action<br>
        &#x25CF; Takeovers can reach $200,000 per day<br>
  - question: What is the best format for a Twitter ad?
    answer: >-
        If you’re targeting a specific group of users, follower tweets may be a better option. Promoting
        ads may be the best choice if you’re on a tight budget. If you want to create buzz and
        engagement, takeovers might be the way to go. Whatever format you choose, ensure your ad is
        well-crafted and relevant to your audience.
  - question: Is the Twitter ads mockup tool free?
    answer: >-
        inBeat is proud to offer a free Twitter Ads mockup generator. We care about our customers and
        are here to help you succeed.<br>
        However, our paid plans are still worth looking into. For just a few dollars a month, you can
