    - question: How do You Calculate an Instagram Account's Engagement Rate?
      answer: >-
        We calculate an Instagram profile's engagement rate by making an average of their likes and comments for their last
        12 posts. Engagement rate can vary from post to post, making it crucial to measure engagement across multiple posts.
    - question: Why should I Calculate an Influencer's Engagement Rate?
      answer: >-
        It provides you a good overview of an Instagram influencer's audience engagement. In other words, do people react to
        a profile's content? You should always measure the number of likes and comments; followers can be a deceiving metric.
        As a rule of thumb, a higher engagement rate is better, and a higher comment to likes is even better.
    - question: Why Use inBeat's Instagram Engagement Calculator?
      answer: >-
        Fair question. It's free, and we do all of the work for you. We don't ask for an email or watermark your report. If
        you need to, you can even use our information as a presentation tool for your clients. We've got you covered! Anyhow,
        use this free tool to identify the best opportunities for your influencer marketing campaign and generate the best
        ROI for your marketing costs.
    - question: How Can I Use The Information In My Influencer Marketing?
      answer: >-
        It's always a tricky question to answer, but here is how we do it. We use the engagement rate as a gauge of trust for
        the influencers we work with throughout our influencer marketing campaigns. It isn't the only thing you should analyze.
        Instagram influencers can purchase fake comments and likes, which can make this metric obsolete. Although there are
        tools out there to calculate the number of fake followers, a judgment call will always outperform these tools. Ask
        yourself questions such as: are there comments shallow or off-topic? Do they have a low number of comments?
    - question: What type of content gets the better engagement on Instagram?
      answer: >-
        The best-performing content for influencers tends to be authentic content and compelling content. 
        The posts must have 5-10 relevant hashtags. Video content and Instagram reels are also good ways to boost engagement rates.
    - question: What is a good engagement rate on Instagram?
      answer: >-
        Between 1 and 3% is considered an average engagement rate. 
        The higher the engagement rate goes from here, the more audience quality the influencer (or creator) has. Audience age is also a factor, as younger generations tend to be more active and willing to comment on Instagram. 
        Follower count is also a big factor, the more followers you have, the more difficult it gets to engage them.
    - question: How can you use engagement rate for your influencer marketing?
      answer: >-
        The more engaged users an influencer gets, the most willing to interact with the post the audience is. 
        It is a good metric to identify an active audience that is more likely to be responsive to your campaign. 
        Engagement rate is one of the top factors for DTC brands when forecasting influencer marketing ROI.
    - question: Why should I care about the Instagram engagement rate for influencer marketing?
      answer: >- 
        Far too often, companies doing influencer marketing only focus on vanity metrics when evaluating influencers (followers, likes, impressions). 
        Vanity metrics matter but they don't tell the whole story. If the target audience is engaged towards the influencer you are collaborating with (either posts or Instagram stories) your company will have more chance of building a successful campaign.

      answer: >-
        The engagement rate will show you how an influencer’s audience interacts with their content on TikTok. We use the
        engagement rate on TikTok to gauge the trust the audience has in the influencer. Now, it isn’t the only thing you
